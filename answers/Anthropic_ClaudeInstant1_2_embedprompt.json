And do you have enough grit? Do you have enough like resilience to stay with it when it gets hard? Because everyone gets lucky in minimal ways every week.

Because the fact that I had a student loan and I owed that money made me feel very uncomfortable. So any money we had, we first tried to pay as much as we can towards the student loan. We always saved a little bit because we believed savings was important. And then we live life for the rest of the money and it wasn't about clothes. It wasn't about having a good time. It was just about living life within our means.\n\nAnd we balanced our checkbook every week. I mean, we were meticulous in how we manage life.
