These are, this is designed and it's up to me to work, to live up to these moments that are put in front of me, but certainly in the way that you're defining it, I would say luck. Yeah, work really hard, but you could work really hard and never get the breaks. You know, work really hard and never be seen, be heard. You can work really hard and you know, no one reads your scripts on a plane and calls you the next day and says, look, let me be in it. Who ends up being the same guy who gets you Selma, get that gets nominated for the Oscar that does today. You could be, you could make 13th. And you know, it sits on the back channels of Netflix and doesn't really get seen or move, but it moved. You can, you can make, when they see us, you know, and not change the lives of the five, five-minute, it doesn't completely revolutionized who they are as human beings. They live differently than they did when it first came out because no one saw it and it didn't make a difference, but that did. And so, you know, there's only so far that the work can get you. And that's far like, I believe I would have gotten far from just sheer hard labor, but there has been a furthering beyond that that has been blessings that have come into my life that are beyond my control. And some people call that luck. I'll take it."

        "answer": "I think the role of luck is vastly under appreciated. I think the action you take when an opportunity appears is yours, and it's the choice and willingness to take the risk and decision to just go for it and sort of damage your dose sort of moment. But if you are unwilling to move or unable to recognize, or don't encounter these moments of opportunity, you know, it's probably not available to you. And I, I feel a certain degree of guilt that some brilliant people I know may not have had some of these moments and they, they could have been much more successful than they are. And yet I do think that probably moments of luck appear in front of most of us at some point or another in our lives. And what do you do after once you see one of those have one of those, it does come down to work ethic and just willingness to grind, then sleep less and compromise things like work-life balance, which have their own consequences. It's not free and it can be very damaging, but luck is the kickstart."

It's not something you can learn in school. So I'm very grateful for what America has enabled our family to achieve. And, you know, having this passion for aviation and the airline business is just, it's been the fuel that kept things going."

        "answer": "I would say that a lot of it has to do with hard work. We worked 11 hours a day for seven days a week for probably five years. But at the same time we have been incredibly lucky because of all of the people that we've come across who have been so supportive and kind from the film distributors early on to the people who helped us get started in Austin. We didn't tell you the story about the food purveyor at Cisco, who knew that we were an impoverished couple that was asking him for samples to develop our menu just so that we would have something to eat. And he provided us with huge amounts of samples. Anyway, he knew that that's what we were doing and he did it anyway, so yeah. Also a good deal of luck in there,\n\nOh, you know, it's, it's, it's definitely a mix, you know, and I'm, I'm not unaware of like, the basic luck that I have, just the privilege of having a stable family life and supporting parents and a good education and not really like having a nuclear family. It just like, it's, you know, it's all I know, right? But I know that that's not everybody. And I, I'm keenly aware that that has given me what others don't have. And, you know, I, I certainly work really hard. I I still like doing it. And on the flip side, just like, like life is just full of these weird little moments like having a lease sign pop up or you know, that we were able to get financing before we ran out of payroll. Right. So I, I put the scales more, more in luck than in hard work, but gosh darn, I can work pretty hard when I need to."

That was the secret sauce of Alienware was the differences in opinions and the respect that everybody had for one another. And all, all of that was there luck? There was an enormous amount of luck. So many other things could have gone wrong and a lot of things went wrong. This was not a perfect journey by any means. I mean, there was an enormous amount of a obstacles that were presented along the way, and harder work had to overcome those obstacles. But I think it's the people, and it was the luck of those people coming together that were really the driving forces from my perspective.\n\nYou know, interesting you say about, you know, you talk about work, I think I, if I had to give one piece of advice to an entrepreneur is if you're not smarter than they are, then I'll work them. If you have a tendency of saying, Hey, I'm, these people are smarter than me, my competitors, my whatever, but you know, I'm, I'm pretty smart too, and I cannot outwork them, so I'm gonna work hard. I think that's one of the biggest things that we all had in common. We worked really, really, really hard because we just did not have the formal training that we needed. But beyond all things, I think that without passion, we're nothing. And I think if you take that approach as an entrepreneur and, and, and look at business that way, and, you know, not do it just solely for the money, but for whatever else drives you, you know, I, I think you'll be okay."

And when it's just seemed like it was impossible, we've, we've managed to find a different solution and, and keep on going a little bit and you need that. And, and, you know, but if, if, if we've had any luck, if I've had any luck personally, I mean, I, I think we've been given an enormous leg up with our families and with our, our mum and dad and now with our, with our wives and, and, you know, that was a, that was a loving household, that valued education that encouraged us to go and take risks and do what we wanted to do.\n\nAnd not everyone has that. And it's been enormously important part of the journey because I think we've lent on them right now. I have at key moments, very, very heavily to keep on going.\n\nYeah, I think they're, they're inextricably linked. I've always thought of luck as some random event happening to you, but that happens. And then what are you gonna do with it? And I think we've, we've had the good fortune together to, to have great timing across a whole host of things. Like we could start a business and put up a website in seven months and reach 10,000 people in, in, in a week. But we also, you know, we, we seized and capitalized on that opportunity and we worked super hard and made some good decisions along the way to turn that luck into something that was really positive. So I just, I just think you can't, can't really separate those, those ideas or that construct.\n\nAnd, and fortunately, we've, we've done a, we've had a good bit of both"

I think there's some skill in that. I think I was blessed with the ability to interact with people and build rapport pretty quickly. And I knew the importance of that. And Anne had so many other gifts, the marketing side, the creative side, the initial finance side, that we were able to understand our talents and pull it together. And, you know, no doubt there was good, fortunate luck that comes your way at the right time. Things happen, a credit card mailing comes in and I mean, it's, there is there's luck involved in this. And we were just fortunate at the right time. We made some good decisions and rebounded well from some bad decisions. Boy, you know, I've seen a lot of really good people work just as hard as us or harder and not experience the same good fortune that we've had. And so I, I think it does take, I mean, we made a conscious effort to create Goodwill and positivity.

I could figure out how to quantify it, but I think there's a tendency among people who have some more to come up with success. When they're asked a question like that and public to say, Oh, it's all luck or believe their own hype, to the extent that they think it was all grit and determination and planning. I think it's gotta be a mixture. I do think there are a handful of things I've done, right. And the fact of the matter is I've gotten a lot wrong. Like I had made so many mistakes and have brought myself to the brink of destruction. I mean, not just once but multiple times, right? I mean, a lot of days I would just like role out of bed. And I looked like, ER, and then I like get up and somehow managed to like get to a basic level of consciousness by jumping into a cold pool and like eating a handful of walnuts. And then I like putz around and I'm not sure what to do for three hours. And then I spend the next three hours, like beating the hell out of myself in my own head because I'm so unproductive and on and on and on, right. That is the majority of my days look, something like that. Despite that I think that I am very good at thinking about bets and experiments that have limited downside that have incredibly high upside if they work out. And I put those in a calendar and I try a lot of things. And for that reason, I, I would really hope that where I've ended up is not all luck because there's nothing to be learned there. Right. There's not going to be learned. And I don't think it's all luck, I guess, just to, to keep doing what I'm doing and a half to tell myself some version of that story. But I think it's true.

If we couldn't have bought the store that Blue Mercury, that would've been a, what we would call a single point of failure. So luck plays into it, but I think, you know, for listeners to know that you have to be doing the hard work, you have to be prepared. I mean, who said it better than Nike? Which is just do it. You have to get in the game. You have to be in the game because you have to be in there for these good things to happen to you.\n\nI, yeah, I mean, you know, first one story that we didn't talk about, which is Leonard Lauder wandered into Blue Mercury in about 2000 and I happened to be there, so that's luck. But I seized that opportunity and went right up to him and said, I wanna sell your brands, you know, and he, you know, he said to me, You're too small, but stay in touch. And over the years he became a mentor of ours and when we had tough times or we needed advice, we went to him. So, you know, I tell our kids, never miss an opportunity to be fabulous. Those opportunities come and you need to know how to seize them. But it is, entrepreneurship is not an easy journey. I mean, sometimes I teach a class at Harvard Business School and I say to the entrepreneurs, you know, Okay, raise your hand if you've ever had a sleepless night or a morning you can't get out of bed for. And about 95% of people in the room raise their hand. Entrepreneurship is really, really hard. And I have tremendous respect for anyone who not only starts but you know, really pushes to survive long enough for good things to happen. There is no such thing as overnight success."

        "answer": "Luck is a concept that I thought of in a straight forward way for a while. And then when I converted to Judaism last February, I became acquainted with this concept of kismet, which is, I don't even pronouncing it right, probably, but it's kind of the intersection of luck and serendipity. And maybe even some measure of destiny. I don't want to go that far because I still don't know why really bad things happen to good people. So I think you've gotta be open in life to the way that the universe is trying to help you. The people who love you, who if you just listened to them and cultivate relationships with people who are direct will tell you what you need to hear. If it's not what you want to hear the same thing at accompany, the people along the way, your board, your investors, your employees, who know as a collective, what to do more so than you, but in combination. And you can unlock that. So I think if you bring self-awareness and you bring empathy and you bring positivity and you bring intellectual honesty and courage, you ultimately try to make good decisions. I think you can influence a lot, but I would attribute this outcome in this company at the end of the day to three things, to the quality of the people around me on all fronts, to the hard work of those people who, who really believed in this and made this happen, the team, and then a healthy, healthy dose of self-awareness in the pursuit of, of kismet.\n\nI am. I am. I think that the two things that you're the two really big things that influence your life, the family that you're born into. And I don't know what I call it, that your DNA, the genetic stock, who, you know, who, how you show up as a creature, as a human being, you have no control over those two things. And so I feel like in life I was dealt. If we call it luck, you know, I don't want to say pocket ACEs. Cause I don't know what, how to think about my genetic makeup, but I was born into the most incredible family ever. And I was given the best of all opportunities, wanting for nothing educationally or experientially, the best mom, the best at the best sister. Now I've got the best wife. So with all that and all the amazing groups of people I've been around, I owe it to everyone to do something akin to this. And at the end of the day, the credit goes to them in so many ways."

So that part I can't say this lucky was just just you know, just doing it.\n\nYeah, I mean look we didn't we didn't raise a ton of money out of the gate. So I think to answer a question is probably 50/50 if if Dave didn't leave the business when he did then Vicki couldn't have come on and taking a salary which means we you know, we might not have been able to continue if that hadn't happened. Like she said if I hadn't had that quick conversation with Neil and a thousand other conversations that I've had with other entrepreneurs along the way to find out little tidbits.\n\nYeah, but it's stopping that person in the street and emailing them I think part of it like and try to give that back also like I think Rich especially takes a lot of coffee meetings because he always talks about all the people that when he reached out to them gave him advice. So, you know, he and I both try to pay that forward."

Just like keep paddling, keep paddling, keep paddling and this business, I mean really it started snowballing from the first day we launched Kickstarter. But I, I mean, I can say unequivocally that like we got really lucky. Like our timing was really good. I'm not sure if we had started a year before or a year after if things would've been the same, but the timing was right and it's just been a remarkable shift in like seeing the difference between a boulder being pushed up the hill and a boulder rolling down the hill. And you know, I worked way harder at my first company and it didn't work. Like I, I always thought that I would run a big company, but I did not think that this was gonna be the big company."

And I think we've had a lot of counterintuitive decisions along the way, going to LA as our second market, buying a company three times our size that was struggling and converting it. People used to ask me like, you know, the baseball analogy, what inning are you in? And you say, well, we're in the early innings, but I still think we're coming outta the dugout.\n\nTed: Look, I think that anytime you're successful in life, you gotta get lucky. I mean, I was lucky that that banker walked through my door, but he saw the hard work that we put into that restaurant and that's why he gave us that loan. I was lucky enough to meet Brett, but all along the way, we've had so much help. I, I in no way take credit for anything that has happened in the last 16 years. We have had people who have busted their ass in the, in the kitchens for us. People have, you know, busted their ass, growing these restaurants, building these restaurants, doing a lot of the heavy lifting. I get a lot of the credit people come and thank me all the time and say, your restaurant's amazing. What you do is amazing. But the people that work every single day in those restaurants, they are doing a lot of the hard work and they have really helped us build this brand and, and make this what it is today."

Right and we're in the same thing for you the fact that didn't happen to you that's luck. And you know, I look at the family. I was born into I think your family really determines your your ceiling in life and your your floor as well. Like how high both how high or low but there's names are and I had no say in the family that I was born into so I feel incredibly lucky there. I picked the right industry, you know, when that's growing like crazy. So all those things are definitely lat. But I think so. I think we are lucky but I think what amplifies that luck and what makes one successful is hard work. It's skill. It's resilient. It's an appetite for risk taken. So that's my view. I think it's a combination of both but I think when you add those four thins it just ticks lock the whole different level."

Who your parents, who, what was the education that you got? You know, having good health here. There's so many layers of luck. So if you look at all of those things, I couldn't be luckier. But then on the other side of it, I feel like we've planted enough seeds that eventually one of those grows. And so that's kind of another version of Lucky's like we planted maybe a thousand seeds and one of those seeds grew. And so you could kind of attribute that data luck or hard work for planning a thousand seeds. So I'd say a little column A, a little column B."

And, and I think that's a hundred percent true and, and having traits that were ingrained to me since I was little like perseverance and persistence, and to be able to absorb that and work through it and absorbed the ups and downs. I'm lucky that I'm in the position to have that chance and to be where we are at this point in the journey.

What I would say is, you know, both Rashid and I come from immigrant families and you know, just growing up watching my grandmother working two to three different jobs, raising six kids on her own, unable to speak English really well, but it was just, she just did it. And then my dad had that exact same mentality. It's just the mindset that he has always, always had and really instilled in me. That's what I've seen growing up. Rashid comes from a very similar background. I think the two of us is really have this scrappy, resourceful mentality and extremely resilient.

This might be a little bit like that being on the spectrum thing or whatever, but it's just like, whether it's like a really good day or a really bad day, I'm sort of even keeled. And I'm often just like, okay, well what's the next step? How do we fix it? And let's keep making progress even over like a decade or more. I can be quite resilient in that regard. But I guess the other thing I would say just about luck, absolutely luck played a big role in Coinbase. I mean, there were certain moments early on in our history where if a coin had flipped the other way we might not be here.

I, I think all the time about how, while I was in grad school, I was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis and initially had a very inexpensive medication. Hmm. But by the time we started making vlog brothers, I needed to get on a new medication that was 500, $600 a month. And I was able to just do that because I had support for my family. I was able to just like pay another rent to my colon so that I could keep making vo where there's videos. And that was just, that's just not an opportunity for a lot of people. So like even those little things, those little pieces of luck, it's so hard to see them sometimes. Yeah. Like I can't even attribute it to skill because I'm not even that strategic. I just sort of go towards what's working. Yeah. That was, I thought that was a really interesting answer Hank, because like there have been a few moments in our career where we didn't like fly blindly toward the light, like moths at night for reasons we didn't understand. Like there have been a few tactical decisions just like three or four. Yeah. But 99% of the time we've been flying to the light.

So we launched right at the right year and then getting on the radar of retailers and influencers. Like we didn't know that was going to happen. That, that, that was lucky.

So we have to put forth the effort to ensure that we're successful. So we test products many times before putting them out in the world because you only have one chance to earn a customer. They don't give you a second chance, Andrew. And my response would be in line with that. I'd say 70, 30 luck effort in the early years. And more recently, it's been seven days 30 effort."

And we put a lot of time and effort into it and we edited it and we looked at it and we said, I don't like the way it looks like it's okay. No one would really bat an eye at it, but that's not the vision that we had. And we, we went and we redid the whole thing. Right. So that's just so classic dude. Perfect. We have this bar that I think is a lot higher than what most people imagine. It would be at least online. So on the hard work side, I mean, I'm not gonna lie. Like we, you know, we try hard, we take it seriously. It's the most fun thing ever. So we don't take it too seriously, but we take the opportunity that we have with it seriously.

I mean, there's no question that we've all put in a, a lot of work, but I think we would still be putting in that work. I mean, I was putting in that work when I was doing landscaping, our personalities have always like, the way we were raised is, you know, you've got to work for, for something it's not just going to be handed to you. And so I think we tend to look at it, maybe not so much of luck, but more so that God has blessed us with this platform for a reason. And even if it's just as simple as providing content for families to sit down and watch together, I think we, we hope it minimum. Like that's what we can provide for people.

But I founded the company in 2011 and it took until 20, like 15, 20 16 to see signs of life. And so, I mean, it's hard to attribute anything of that to luck that was pure grind. Probably a level of psychosis of not giving up and still believing in the stuff. And then I knew it could be successful. But the fact that it was that successful, that it was like a phenomenon like that, that was, there was a lot of luck involved in that, you know what I mean? I I I I was fully competent that it could be a pretty good ice cream that could, you know, get into the top 10 or something like that and, and provide a good living, but becoming a phenomenon. There was a lot of luck, a lot of right place at the right time involved in that. So I'm going to give you the cliched cop out answer and say 50 50."

And I think like in making the ideas come to life, I think we've, we've worked really hard to go do that and I think made a lot of conscious decisions over time. Some days I'm like, oh gosh, I just wish we could get a break. And then we get a great break and it's awesome and we learn something new. But I think that's probably a function of the fact that we have a team that's continuing to iterate and innovate. And so I guess, you know, in that way, like we do kind of manufacture our, our own, our own luck success.\n\nAndy: I think Jeff's being modest because I would find he'd be a really lucky guy to have started two multi-billion dollar brands and just gotten lucky. So there, there's probably, you know, 15 or 20 people on the planet who can say that they've successfully started two multi-billion dollar companies. I would ascribe the lucky part to be like situation and circumstance. Like I was lucky having access to like amazing education and, you know, the, the a network where fundraising was easier than it might be for somebody who was born into a different environment. You know, I think the adversity along the way and kind of determination to sort of push through that adversity is, is not luck at all. It's just hard work. It's me and Jeff that, that have to sort of steer the, the ship there. So, you know, I, I don't think that part is, is luck. A lot of that's hard work."

I mean, having the company fail multiple times, like drug addiction, alcoholism, like there's all these like really tough things.

You know, why would I be the person to do this? I'm so unqualified, you know because I was unqualified.

Right. And these days, these days, you know, MailChimp is much bigger. And I get invited to ritzy events with some really great business leaders.

And so I don't think of, I don't think luck is, is the word that I would use. I would think, I would say that we dove in a hundred percent and we made that commitment and the universe supported us. And it's always a team effort between what we do in this physical world and making sure that the message that we're sending to, to the other realm is that we really want this, we're really committed to it, and we're gonna do whatever it takes to make it happen.

And so in a lot of ways, at least personally, I feel like very appreciative of sort of the, you could call it luck to of the timing and the opportunity to, to do this. I also think just to, to the general point of view your question, like, we wouldn't have been able to make it if we didn't work extremely hard from the get-go. You know, I've done a thousand things in my life, 999 of them haven't worked. Patrion was one that happened to work. Was I smarter? Did I make better decisions? The patient like, no, I mean, it just was like, it was a lot of happenstance and circumstance and, and, you know, sound like killed ourselves to like, to, to, to, you know, do it. Of course, I love this attitude too, because it puts us in a place where I think both of us feel an immense sense of responsibility and that we have to be great stewards right. Of both creators and, and the opportunity and, and even our teams that are helping us along on this mission. And I think we take that very seriously."

You have to keep going.\n\nYeah, there, there is a, there is a drive and a motivation in the art of creation. You've got to love it, right? You have to be okay. Not knowing and being on that edge and, and right into that edge of being like comfortable and overstretched. I always find that that's where the most creative things come from. And as well said, like you get a lot of things wrong, you know, and, and you, as long as you learn from it, you have a safe space to allow for people to actually learn from it.

Hard work is hard. Work is table stakes, right?

Like nobody wills something into existence alone. You have a lot of people who are helping you, who've helped you in the past, who are helping you in real time to do the impossible. And I don't think people appreciate luck of just being in the right place at the right time of having an idea that works now, that might not work tomorrow or might not have worked yesterday of running into the right co-founder. Like if I don't ask Jen Hurley, who's was working in our finance department about where she's going and she had not told me, oh, I'm going skiing with this guy Roy Schwartz, who's really interesting and you should talk to him about business. He's just a smart guy. Like that's pure luck. Like how did I have that conversation with her? And she pointed me to Roy, if we didn't have Roy Schwartz, Axio wouldn't have existed. Hmm. Or how do I end up on the Lido deck in Genoa, Italy during the trade protest when I'm working at the Wall Street Journal and I turn to the person next to me at 4:00 AM who looks at me and says with his beer in his hand for speed. And it's Mike Allen wanting to see who can slam a beer faster and starts a lifelong friendship. How do we have a spark of an idea to start Politico? And it just happens to be at that very moment the Internet's taking off and cable has an insatiable appetite and we happen to run into the right mix of reporters that can bring it into existence. Like so much of that is luck and it's perishable and I just don't feel like people appreciate that enough."

A lot of people would like an amazing partner, but they're like, how do I find one? And, and you know, sometimes when you want to find one, you can't just go find one. And I think those moments that that hit you, that make you, that are just the spark of an idea. I mean those are just lucky moments. The fact that Galen's girls couldn't find the orange jackets, as annoying as that was at the time, was the, the spark, you know, of an idea that I don't know if we would've come to otherwise. And at the same time, I think we would certainly say in e-commerce in particular, if anyone thinks it's glamorous, it just isn't.\n\nAnd to be successful in e-commerce, I mean it is just a lot of grinding it out, a lot of like blocking and tackling how many more cliches can I use? It just, it just is. And so I think that there's no way that an enormous amount of hard work isn't necessary to be successful in this industry.\n\nI think we've just learned too how important timing is to whether something can work or not. And so I think probably on balance, I lean a little more luck as the answer. And I think too, so many founders and companies have like worked so hard and had a good idea and been really smart about it, but it just didn't quite work. And so I think, yeah, there's a little bit of like, we've, we've been lucky on the timing and some of the decisions that we happen to get right? 'cause I think the, the difference between like a company that makes it and a company doesn't often comes down to something like really small.\n\nSo feel very lucky to be where we are."

I think it was lucky that I got to meet that we got to meet each other, that I got to meet Julia. And then she got to meet me. I think it was lucky that we got to have these incredible riders who inspired us every day and get to work with people that we loved. And it was extremely high touch. We always had our, our, our office attached to a studio. We never stopped using the product. And, and I think, you know, that kind of effort that we would, that we brought to it created, I guess you could call it like a certain kind of cumulative magic that happened over the years that everybody participated in and created."

Ben was constantly going out and meeting with the inventors, going to their offices, doing inventor trips. We did all that stuff. And the last thing I'd say is that we never blamed anybody for failure because it's too complex in our business. There's too many stakeholders when you're doing creative things that you can blame one single person. So for sure, listen to the universe works in strange ways.

And then you get less control, less and less control and who your child meets and where they go and how they grow up. There's not very much in your control at all. There's a lot of luck there.

One is one, but one in one is not two. It becomes 11. And the third one becomes 111. And as every family member joined our growth possibilities increased and we were able to do a lot more.\n\nYeah. And I, I think, I think about this question, you know, a couple of different ways, you know, one is perspective for mom. If she hadn't taken the right attitude towards the fire and worked through that fire situation, or, you know, done, done so many things where it was a make or break moment for the company that we wouldn't be here today and that's pure hard work, but for me, it's, it's luck. You know, it's being born into a certain family, having a certain mom that would do those types of things. And so it's not an either or, but a both.\n\nSo, you know, 17 years coming into the country, we worked certain there and I worked seven days a week, 14 hours a day. The only time we would get together was a Sunday evening when everybody did their farmer's markets or demos and came back, that was the only meal in the evening that we all shared together. It was sheer hard labor that we did. And the children of course put in just as much from day one. So those were the things which really, I think, supplied the fire and the fuel to the company."

And I think, you know, if you want to talk about the luckiest things that probably had sort of the absolutely necessary parts of it, I had to be a young woman growing up in the seventies and eighties, not in the forties and fifties that's luck. I probably had to grow up in a family that was encouraging me to be an entrepreneur, even though that might not be something young women in the south did at the time that's luck. I had to grow up and not be battling abject poverty. Yeah. That's luck. So when you look at all of those very lucky things, and then you add on to it, all of the things, the happenstance meetings and the people that offered me a hand up, I mean, I'd say it's 90% luck. But then what I would say is the part that I can control is the 10% that's work. And so it may only be 10%, but I'm going to work as hard as I can to control that 10%."

I think that, you know, beating the right people, bearing the right woven, hiring the right people, or being lucky enough to be exposed to talent, that there is an art and a science to hiring people, I think would be the best way to express it. And part of that art involves luck. We were lucky to meet the rice brothers and Savannah. Larry Lee was a stroke of luck. If I hadn't attended that industry event, I'd never would have met Larry. So I think that if an entrepreneur or a business person always wants to be the smartest person in the room, I think their, their opportunities are limited. I always took great pleasure in being able to find people who had different skillsets and were smarter in the areas that they were strong with than I was. I think that that's how you get one-on-one and come up with three."

And so you can seize those opportunities or not, but the first thing you need is those opportunities to exist for you. And so I definitely feel tremendously lucky to be born where and when and all sorts of things. And I like, I don't take that for granted. I take it very seriously that like we have an obligation for those of us who have had opportunities to use part of our time and our money on this planet to try to create more opportunities for our people."

It's sort of not a joke. I was very smart. I was very hardworking. I was very persistent in the face of a lot of failure. And then I was also very lucky and for something to be as big and successful as Twitch, you kind of got to do all four. I guess more luck can make up for less of the other three. But the best you're going to do is like 50% luck. And I've now been around the valley for 15 years. And I came here with a bunch of people who started making companies. And I don't know anyone who persisted and try it again and then try it and then try the new thing and then try it again. Who has had some level of success. Eventually you do get lucky. Now. Now was it, was, was it going to be Twitch sized lucky? No, no, no. And there's a lot of lower levels of lucky that are still success. Absolutely. And so I think at some level that I was successful, I at all, I attribute to some combination of hard work persistence intelligence that I was successful in. Anything resembling the scale of Twitch. That's the, there's a huge portion of luck there. That is, that is undeniable."

You know, if Chris McDowell had never written that book, if Steven wasn't an internet marketer, if he and I didn't have complimentary skillsets, I, I would never have been able to create this business without him. He would never have been able to create this business without me. So without luck, you know, there, there are just so many ways this could never have happened or had a premature demise.\n\nSteven: First of all, when I listen to your show, this is my favorite part because this is something that I think people over, well look, we know from psychological research, people over at value their own role and things that go well and undervalue it and things that go badly. When I was in film school, one of our teachers was the now late director of Mueller Foreman and someone said to him one day, how do you make a good movie? And pardon my bad check accent, milish Mueller said, well, making good movies, he's 90% casting. And as the other 10% is also casting. And so that's how I think of business. It's 90% luck and the other 10% is also luck. And then just like Lena said, there's a whole separate a hundred percent where it's 90% working your butt off and the other 10% hopefully being smart enough or finding someone smart enough to know how to put out the fires that started overnight despite the fact that nothing changed since yesterday. Yeah. So, you know, hopefully with a little gratitude, humility and not trying to reinvent a wheel that put itself together in ways that I can't imagine, it's gonna be interesting to see what happens next."
