How much of, of where you are today, do you attribute to just the grind and how hard you worked in and does any part of you attribute any of it to luck as well? Or what do you think?\n\nAnswer: I guess I, I attribute it to luck, but I don't call it luck. You know, I think it's, it's my path and it was, these are blessings. These are, this is designed and it's up to me to work, to live up to these moments that are put in front of me, but certainly in the way that you're defining it, I would say luck. Yeah, work really hard, but you could work really hard and never get the breaks. You know, work really hard and never be seen, be heard. You can work really hard and you know, no one reads your scripts on a plane and calls you the next day and says, look, let me be in it.

I think the action you take when an opportunity appears is yours, and it's the choice and willingness to take the risk and decision to just go for it and sort of damage your dose sort of moment. But if you are unwilling to move or unable to recognize, or don't encounter these moments of opportunity, you know, it's probably not available to you. And I, I feel a certain degree of guilt that some brilliant people I know may not have had some of these moments and they, they could have been much more successful than they are. And yet I do think that probably moments of luck appear in front of most of us at some point or another in our lives. And what do you do after once you see one of those have one of those, it does come down to work ethic and just willingness to grind, then sleep less and compromise things like work-life balance, which have their own consequences. It's not free and it can be very damaging, but luck is the kickstart."

And the question is, are you, are you alert enough to know you're being lucky or you're, you're becoming lucky. Are you talented enough to take that advantage and run with it? And do you have enough grit? Do you have enough like resilience to stay with it when it gets hard? Because everyone gets lucky in minimal ways every week. I mean, you find a dollar on the ground or, you know, you get a break at work to work on a cool project, or you meet someone interesting. The, the difference between people, I think who succeed in the long run and the people who don't is frankly, that optimism that like you got lucky and now it's yours to yours to make awesome."

Being that we had built that is like based on humanity and patience and real things and things that we do with our hands and not with our thumbs and to not put more of that in the world.

I mean, it's, you know, to, to me, in some way, being married is like having a partner and it takes a tremendous amount of work.\n\nSo, you know, I think if you're not prepared to do the work, you shouldn't get into the relationship.
