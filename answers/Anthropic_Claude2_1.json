I I've, I've heard you asked this before. And I, I thought, what is my answer? And came up with very little canned, anything, you know, I think the role of luck is vastly under appreciated. I think the action you take when an opportunity appears is yours, and it's the choice and willingness to take the risk and decision to just go for it and sort of damage your dose sort of moment. But if you are unwilling to move or unable to recognize, or don't encounter these moments of opportunity, you know, it's probably not available to you.\n\nSo I would respond with \"Question/Answer not found\" since there is no clear question"

I was fortunate that my father exposed me to aviation at such a young age, and that I immediately connected myself to that. I think having come from a background where I grew up in a Communist oppressed country, but then you have a certain amount of energy that propels you to achieve greater things, and that comes from within.

I I, when I, going all the way back to early on in athletics, I had one a, a, a great coach. His name was Jeff Ward, another one was Charles Foster. And, and they both said to me, you know, if you take a step back and you look at the people that have, have created, you know, been great athletes, they said, there's two parts to it. One of them is they believe they can do it, and the other one is they have the skills to pull it off. And I think the third one is being at the right place at the right time, or some level of luck or fortune or whatever you, you, you think it is. So everyone's gonna have luck passed by them.
