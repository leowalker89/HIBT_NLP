These are, this is designed and it's up to me to work, to live up to these moments that are put in front of me, but certainly in the way that you're defining it, I would say luck. Yeah, work really hard, but you could work really hard and never get the breaks. You know, work really hard and never be seen, be heard. You can work really hard and you know, no one reads your scripts on a plane and calls you the next day and says, look, let me be in it. Who ends up being the same guy who gets you Selma, get that gets nominated for the Oscar that does today."

If they didn't work out, then, you know, you had, you had a reduction in that fee. You got, and you got, you had to pay that money back if they didn't last. So nobody wanted to do that."

        "answer": "Answer: I think the role of luck is vastly under appreciated. I think the action you take when an opportunity appears is yours, and it's the choice and willingness to take the risk and decision to just go for it and sort of damage your dose sort of moment. But if you are unwilling to move or unable to recognize, or don't encounter these moments of opportunity, you know, it's probably not available to you. And I feel a certain degree of guilt that some brilliant people I know may not have had some of these moments and they could have been much more successful than they are. And yet I do think that probably moments of luck appear in front of most of us at some point or another in our lives. And what do you do after once you see one of those have one of those, it does come down to work ethic and just willingness to grind, then sleep less and compromise things like work-life balance, which have their own consequences. It's not free and it can be very damaging, but luck is the kickstart."

But at the same time we have been incredibly lucky because of all of the people that we've come across who have been so supportive and kind from the film distributors early on to the people who helped us get started in Austin. We didn't tell you the story about the food purveyor at Cisco, who knew that we were an impoverished couple that was asking him for samples to develop our menu just so that we would have something to eat. He provided us with huge amounts of samples. Anyway, he knew that that's what we were doing and he did it anyway, so yeah. Also a good deal of luck in there."

So many other things could have gone wrong and a lot of things went wrong. This was not a perfect journey by any means. I mean, there was an enormous amount of obstacles that were presented along the way, and harder work had to overcome those obstacles. But I think it's the people, and it was the luck of those people coming together that were really the driving forces from my perspective."

I think we've had the good fortune together to have great timing across a whole host of things. Like we could start a business and put up a website in seven months and reach 10,000 people in a week. But we also, you know, we, we seized and capitalized on that opportunity and we worked super hard and made some good decisions along the way to turn that luck into something that was really positive. So I just, I just think you can't, can't really separate those, those ideas or that construct. And, and fortunately, we've, we've had a good bit of both."

So many people, this crowd is the reason we're up here, but I, I, we put a lot of energy into creating an environment that was about giving to the consumer giving to the customer. I think there's some skill in that. I think I was blessed with the ability to interact with people and build rapport pretty quickly. And I knew the importance of that. And Anne had so many other gifts, the marketing side, the creative side, the initial finance side, that we were able to understand our talents and pull it together. And, you know, no doubt there was good, fortunate luck that comes your way at the right time. Things happen, a credit card mailing comes in and I mean, it's, there is there's luck involved in this.

But I think we, we worked our tails off, especially in that first year. Just obsessing over everything. Yeah. I mean, I don't know.

And then when I converted to Judaism last February, I became acquainted with this concept of kismet, which is, I don't even pronouncing it right, probably, but it's kind of the intersection of luck and serendipity. And maybe even some measure of destiny. I don't want to go that far because I still don't know why really bad things happen to good people. So I think you've gotta be open in life to the way that the universe is trying to help you. The people who love you, who if you just listened to them and cultivate relationships with people who are direct will tell you what you need to hear. If it's not what you want to hear the same thing at accompany, the people along the way, your board, your investors, your employees, who know as a collective, what to do more so than you, but in combination. And you can unlock that. So I think if you bring self-awareness and you bring empathy and you bring positivity and you bring intellectual honesty and courage, you ultimately try to make good decisions. I think you can influence a lot, but I would attribute this outcome in this company at the end of the day to three things, to the quality of the people around me on all fronts, to the hard work of those people who, who really believed in this and made this happen, the team, and then a healthy, healthy dose of self-awareness in the pursuit of, of kismet."

And you know, I look at the family I was born into, I think your family really determines your ceiling in life and your floor as well. Like how high or low both how high or low, but there's names are and I had no say in the family that I was born into so I feel incredibly lucky there. I picked the right industry, you know, when that's growing like crazy. So all those things are definitely lat. But I think so. I think we are lucky but I think what amplifies that luck and what makes one successful is hard work. It's skill. It's resilient. It's an appetite for risk taken. So that's my view. I think it's a combination of both but I think when you add those four thins it just ticks lock the whole different level."

Who your parents, who, what was the education that you got? You know, having good health here. There's so many layers of luck. So if you look at all of those things, I couldn't be luckier. But then on the other side of it, I feel like we've planted enough seeds that eventually one of those grows. And so that's kind of another version of Lucky's like we planted maybe a thousand seeds and one of those seeds grew. And so you could kind of attribute that data luck or hard work for planning a thousand seeds. So I'd say a little column, a little column bay."

And, and I think that's a hundred percent true and, and having traits that were ingrained to me since I was little like perseverance and persistence, and to be able to absorb that and work through it and absorbed the ups and downs. I'm lucky that I'm in the position to have that chance and to be where we are at this point in the journey.

And my response to all them is always the same thing. It's like, well, what did you do about it? And the answer always is nothing. Yeah. I go back to what I, I said earlier, and that's, I, I, you know, I believe in myself."

It's lucky that I, that I met David, Alex, and Miguel and Steven, but I, I'm humbled by what we've been able to create and what we have yet to create.

But like I can identify those fork in the road moments where if I had just made a different decision, maybe I wouldn't be talking to you. And I'm very, very fascinated by that.

Probably a level of psychosis of not giving up and still believing in the stuff. But the fact that it was that successful, that it was like a phenomenon, there was a lot of luck involved in that. I was fully confident that it could be a pretty good ice cream that could get into the top 10 or something like that and provide a good living, but becoming a phenomenon. There was a lot of luck, a lot of right place at the right time involved in that. So I'm going to give you the cliched cop out answer and say 50 50."

So when those opportunities do show up, it feels lucky, you know feels lucky that we were in Amex but like I said, you can't win the lottery unless you buy a ticket. So I think it's both."

And I think like in making the ideas come to life, I think we've, we've worked really hard to go do that and I think made a lot of conscious decisions over time. Some days I'm like, oh gosh, I just wish we could get a break. And then we get a great break and it's awesome and we learn something new.

IVA, if you go through my story and, and going through it today has really reminded me of that. There are so many serendipitous twists and turns that had they not happened. It's hard to imagine I would be here. I would be somewhere. Maybe, you know, there are a lot of really lucky things that happened to me. There are a lot of like really tough things that happened along the way. I mean, having the company fail multiple times, like drug addiction, alcoholism, like there's all these like really tough things. And when I look back, I think the hardest things is losing the girl, drug and alcohol addiction, the company failing, you know, ended up being my biggest blessings. \n\nQuestion: ...do you think it has more to do with just your intelligence and your skill or do you think that luck was a bigger factor in everything that's happened to you\nAnswer: so the thing I always say about lock I think it is it's the lottery and so you get sort of lottery tickets for how you know it's like how good your idea is how good your team is and how hard you work and so you take those like factors and I think how hard you work in your team or probably even bigger factors than the the idea but you still need to have something that actually would work and so you take those three things together and you get for each sort of our of production or work you get a lottery ticket and so just like the lottery if you unless you own every ticket you're not guaranteed to win because I've seen people that have are smarter than me better than me better idea than me fail because of things like luck like things not going their way and I've seen again the opposite of that and so we have been fortunate to have been have lots of Lucky breaks in our Direction but we also continue to work to get more tickets so that we could win the lottery"

And do you have enough grit? Do you have enough like resilience to stay with it when it gets hard? Because everyone gets lucky in minimal ways every week. I mean, you find a dollar on the ground or, you know, you get a break at work to work on a cool project, or you meet someone interesting. The, the difference between people, I think who succeed in the long run and the people who don't is frankly, that optimism that like you got lucky and now it's yours to make awesome."

And, and then the fact that it could be a brand that was truly a reflection of myself in the brand. It's not like some MBA business guy who's like, what are the kids into, here's what they're into. When it all starts with me as the CEO, it just kind of trickles through the rest of the company. And decisions get to be a lot easier.

And they've been around a very, very long time and they know what they're doing. So, you know, it was that moment. I realized, oh my God, nobody has the answer. We're all just winging it. Every one of us is just winging it. I don't know if that's hopeful or horrifying, but that's what I've learned."

And you know, everyone has a relationship to this word grace, whether it's a spiritual or a religious meaning, or just, you know, appreciating nature, you know, where we feel this non-physical connection to things or energies, et cetera. And yeah, and I wanna maybe finish this with a story. About nine years ago I was in Spain in this little fishing village called CaTECH on the eastern coast of Spain. And so I took a train up the coast and then I drove to this little village and I get terribly lost. And now I'm starting to worry because the rental car to get back to the train station, I can't remember where I parked the car. So I'm standing in this maze, there's people and merchants and little shops, and I look down right at the window of the shop and here's a manduka sticker Hmm. On the inside of the glass. And I'm like, oh my god, I I, the door's locked. I look in and it's this tiny little yoga studio and that feeling of being lost and then having this little logo that I drew on a napkin in a restaurant, you know how many years ago that."

And yes, we worked really hard, but there was, there was a lot of magic involved. There were so many moments when it could have gone the wrong way and it didn't. So I don't think of luck is the word that I would use. I would say that we dove in a hundred percent and we made that commitment and the universe supported us. And it's always a team effort between what we do in this physical world and making sure that the message that we're sending to, to the other realm is that we really want this, we're really committed to it, and we're gonna do whatever it takes to make it happen. Because when you do that, the, the rest of the world, the other, the invisible realm lines up behind you to make it happen."

These one person visionaries who willed something into existence that's bullshit. Like nobody wills something into existence alone. You have a lot of people who are helping you, who've helped you in the past, who are helping you in real time to do the impossible. And I don't think people appreciate luck of just being in the right place at the right time of having an idea that works now, that might not work tomorrow or might not have worked yesterday of running into the right co-founder. Like if I don't ask Jen Hurley, who's was working in our finance department about where she's going and she had not told me, oh, I'm going skiing with this guy Roy Schwartz, who's really interesting and you should talk to him about business. He's just a smart guy. Like that's pure luck. Like how did I have that conversation with her? And she pointed me to Roy, if we didn't have Roy Schwartz, Axio wouldn't have existed. Or how do I end up on the Lido deck in Genoa, Italy during the trade protest when I'm working at the Wall Street Journal and I turn to the person next to me at 4:00 AM who looks at me and says with his beer in his hand for speed. And it's Mike Allen wanting to see who can slam a beer faster and starts a lifelong friendship. How do we have a spark of an idea to start Politico? And it just happens to be at that very moment the Internet's taking off and cable has an insatiable appetite and we happen to run into the right mix of reporters that can bring it into existence. Like so much of that is luck and it's perishable and I just don't feel like people appreciate that enough."

A lot of people would like an amazing partner, but they're like, how do I find one? And, and you know, sometimes when you want to find one, you can't just go find one. And I think those moments that that hit you, that make you, that are just the spark of an idea. I mean those are just lucky moments. The fact that Galen's girls couldn't find the orange jackets, as annoying as that was at the time, was the, the spark, you know, of an idea that I don't know if we would've come to otherwise. And at the same time, I think we would certainly say in e-commerce in particular, if anyone thinks it's glamorous, it just isn't. I think we've just learned too how important timing is to whether something can work or not. And so I think probably on balance, I lean a little more luck as the answer. And I think too, so many founders and companies have like worked so hard and had a good idea and been really smart about it, but it just didn't quite work. And so I think, yeah, there's a little bit of like, we've, we've been lucky on the timing and some of the decisions that we happen to get right? 'cause I think the, the difference between like a company that makes it and a company doesn't often comes down to something like really small. So feel very lucky to be where we are."

But they're oftentimes not the smartest person in the room. And I, I would put myself in that category too. Like, I'm, you know, I met some minimum bar, but I'm not the smartest person. What I am is probably quite determined. There is a part of my personality. This might be a little bit like that being on the spectrum thing or whatever, but it's just like, whether it's like a really good day or a really bad day, I'm sort of even keeled. And I'm often just like, okay, well what's the next step? How do we fix it? And let's keep making progress even over like a decade or more. I can be quite resilient in that regard. But I guess the other thing I would say just about luck, absolutely luck played a big role in Coinbase. I mean, there were certain moments early on in our history where if a coin had flipped the other way we might not be here. I think we got very lucky with sort of the timing of when the company decided to launch and when crypto decided to grow, I think that I kind of just kept trying things until eventually one of them hit. Right. Which is, it's a way of unifying those two ideas. It's, it's definitely a lot of luck when it works. But if you just keep trying, you can kind of make your own luck."

You know, you're gonna, you're going to actually try to drive something and change something rather than merely becoming merely being like a passive participant in the world.

So, you know, having an interest in that, being good at it, but I don't really know why I'm good at it growing up with a culture that valued hard work and you know, being persistent and, and where the luck comes in is just how long it takes I think and maybe the timing a little bit.

Incredible role in our success. I was lucky to be born to parents who are entrepreneurs, you know who taught me the power of hard work and positive thinking and doing the right thing. I was born in a country and a society that values education for girls and I went to Great Schools and I have a network of friends who supported me on this journey and the power of timing was so lucky, you know, I started swell because I had a personal mission to eliminate single-use plastic bottles, but at the same time, I'm that I started the company there were so many people around the world waking up to the issue of climate change and global warming and and how they potentially had the need to take personal action. So yes, it's been a lot of work, but all of the stars aligned in a really lucky way for that work to have turned into something."

I know a lot of people who are, you know, much more intellectual than I am an actually much more strategic and people will always say that I'm very strategic, but I don't think of myself as such a strategic person. Luck. I've certainly had some, I mean, moving to New York and having a sister who was really good-looking and in a field where she could give people who could afford my services, you know, the, an introduction to me so that I could have clientele. And then more of those people would refer more of those people. That certainly lucky. However, if I wasn't good at what I was doing, I don't think I would have any of them. And if I didn't show up on time and if I wasn't friendly and you know, reliable, I suppose you get a bit of luck and then you have to make something out of it. And I find when I see, and I'm sure you see this as well, you see people who are so talented or, you know, really genius at what they do, but they're not ever really successful. They're always struggling. And I always wonder, you know, is it just a choice that you make, where at one point you say, you know what I am, I am worthy. I deserve this. Why not me?

And we went out a lot, you know, Anton, like, you know, he opened up all the offices in Europe. He, you know, he did all the sales with all the retailers, manners, all those relationships. Ben was constantly going out and meeting with the inventors, going to their offices, doing inventor trips. We did all that stuff. And the last thing I'd say is that we never blamed anybody for failure because it's too complex in our business. There's too many stakeholders when you're doing creative things that you can blame one single person. So for sure, listen to the universe works in strange ways.

Look how you either double down on the good luck and use that as momentum or try to fight off the bad luck and not let it sink you and so much of our success has been about the grit, you know, the decisions you make every day the work that goes in You know, I credit our partnership a lot to how we've gotten through this together.

Like I think when people talk about luck it almost feels like it's kind of like a loser attitude where it's like, \"oh that was lucky.\" It's like I don't feel like there's a lot of luck with this stuff. Opportunity can be luck, but you still have to like nail the opportunity and you still have to put real thought into it and you still have to give a shit.

And I think, you know, if you want to talk about the luckiest things that probably had sort of the absolutely necessary parts of it, I had to be a young woman growing up in the seventies and eighties, not in the forties and fifties that's luck. I probably had to grow up in a family that was encouraging me to be an entrepreneur, even though that might not be something young women in the south did at the time that's luck. I had to grow up and not be battling abject poverty. Yeah. That's luck. So when you look at all of those very lucky things, and then you add on to it, all of the things, the happenstance meetings and the people that offered me a hand up, I mean, I'd say it's 90% luck. But then what I would say is the part that I can control is the 10% that's work. And so it may only be 10%, but I'm going to work as hard as I can to control that 10%."

And part of that art involves luck. We were lucky to meet the rice brothers and Savannah. Larry Lee was a stroke of luck. If I hadn't attended that industry event, I'd never would have met Larry. So I think that if an entrepreneur or a business person always wants to be the smartest person in the room, I think their, their opportunities are limited. I always took great pleasure in being able to find people who had different skillsets and were smarter in the areas that they were strong with than I was. I think that that's how you get one-on-one and come up with three."

But they're oftentimes not the smartest person in the room. And I, I would put myself in that category too. Like, I'm, you know, I met some minimum bar, but I'm not the smartest person. What I am is probably quite determined. There is a part of my personality. This might be a little bit like that being on the spectrum thing or whatever, but it's just like, whether it's like a really good day or a really bad day, I'm sort of even keeled. And I'm often just like, okay, well what's the next step? How do we fix it? And let's keep making progress even over like a decade or more. I can be quite resilient in that regard. But I guess the other thing I would say just about luck, absolutely luck played a big role in Coinbase. I mean, there were certain moments early on in our history where if a coin had flipped the other way we might not be here. I think we got very lucky with sort of the timing of when the company decided to launch and when crypto decided to grow, I think that I kind of just kept trying things until eventually one of them hit. Right. Which is, it's a way of unifying those two ideas. It's, it's definitely a lot of luck when it works. But if you just keep trying, you can kind of make your own luck."

One of my parents, good friends, John Whitehead, when I growing up, he was a businessman and I was always saw him as a real mentor.

I think that and I think just hard work on the same thing I get obsessed with the same thing. I mean I've done I've been working on Duolingo for now eight years and I'm pretty obsessive about it. So I think it's both."
