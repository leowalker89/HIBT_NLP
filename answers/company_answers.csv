Patreon,"I mean, my opinion on this is largely, like, if you're fortunate enough to be, to fall in, in order to build as part of a community that is this excited about an idea, I felt like if it wasn't us, it was going to be someone else. And so in a lot of ways, at least personally, I feel like very appreciative of sort of the, you could call it luck to of the timing and the opportunity to, to do this.

Sukhi’s Gourmet Indian Food,"So all I say, you know, you have to be at the right time at the right place with the right amount of luck. And I think all three contributed to us. And also we had people come into our lives or into the business, which just took us from point a to point B. And you know, there's a saying, which I, a hundred percent believe in. One is one, but one in one is not two. It becomes 11. And the third one becomes 111. And as every family member joined our growth possibilities increased and we were able to do a lot more. Yeah. And I, I think, I think about this question, you know, a couple of different ways, you know, one is perspective for mom. If she hadn't taken the right attitude towards the fire and worked through that fire situation, or, you know, done, done so many things where it was a make or break moment for the company that we wouldn't be here today and that's pure hard work, but for me, it's, it's luck. You know, it's being born into a certain family, having a certain mom that would do those types of things. And so it's not an either or, but a both. So, you know, 17 years coming into the country, we worked certain there and I worked seven days a week, 14 hours a day. The only time we would get together was a Sunday evening when everybody did their farmer's markets or demos and came back, that was the only meal in the evening that we all shared together. It was sheer hard labor that we did. And the children of course put in just as much from day one. So those were the things which really, I think, supplied the fire and the fuel to the company.","Success is attributed to a combination of luck, hard work, and the support of people around them.

Dang Foods,"I would say a ton of our early success was attributed to luck. For example, the timing of coconut chips. If we had waited another year to launch coconut chips, it would have been too late. And if we had gone earlier, it would have been too early. So we launched right at the right year and then getting on the radar of retailers and influencers. Like we didn't know that was going to happen. That, that, that was lucky. Also launching at a time where coconut was on trend. Like that was lucky, but more recently, you know, we have more to lose if we make mistakes. So we have to put forth the effort to ensure that we're successful. So we test products many times before putting them out in the world because you only have one chance to earn a customer. They don't give you a second chance, Andrew. And my response would be in line with that. I'd say 70, 30 luck effort in the early years.

Logic,"I think it's probably somewhere in the middle between the both, you know, I look back at my life and I think being raised by my parents played, played a large role in, in who I am as a person today and instilling confidence in me.

Harry’s Razors,"I think that there's certainly been a lot of serendipity in luck in my life. Like, you know, having been sitting with Neil after class one day when Dave walked up with the idea for Warby Parker, like Andy having gotten to know Andy at Bain, like, gosh, I could have made a hundred different decisions in life that I wouldn't have where I wouldn't have gotten to know him. And I think like in making the ideas come to life, I think we've, we've worked really hard to go do that and I think made a lot of conscious decisions over time. Some days I'm like, oh gosh, I just wish we could get a break. And then we get a great break and it's awesome and we learn something new. But I think that's probably a function of the fact that we have a team that's continuing to iterate and innovate. And so I guess, you know, in that way, like we do kind of manufacture our, our own luck success. I think Jeff's being modest because I would find he'd be a really lucky guy to have started two multi-billion dollar brands and just gotten lucky. So there, there's probably, you know, 15 or 20 people on the planet who can say that they've successfully started two multi-billion dollar companies. I would ascribe the lucky part to be like situation and circumstance. Like I was lucky having access to like amazing education and, the a network where fundraising was easier than it might be for somebody who was born into a different environment. You know, I think the adversity along the way and kind of determination to sort of push through that adversity is, is not luck at all. It's just hard work. It's me and Jeff that, that have to sort of steer the, the ship there. So, you know, I, I don't think that part is, is luck.

You know, I just would keep going and going and going until, until the luck turn my way. So I happened to get lucky.

Shopify,"Honestly, even now, that you talked about us, it's crazy to me, right? I probably try to just not think too much about it. It's hugely gratifying, but it's also, I think, the important thing is just that I remind myself how much of this was luck. The most amazing was coming from a wonderful family here in Canada to support us along the way, the incredible timing of when we started. Like, this is not a kind of company that could have been started even two years later, right? It needed to be started right then, and I needed to be ready and good by the time the opportunity around our financial crisis came around, all these things.

So I'm, I'm pretty fortunate in having that time to take that time off and to start hacking around.

Mary's Gone Crackers,"The way I look at it is that when you get a message from the spirit world or whatever you wanna call it, you hear a voice, you hear, you have an idea that really touches to your core whatever language you wanna use, and you don't honor that, that's a mistake because when you honor it, the universe works with you and supports you. And yes, we worked really hard, but there was, there was a lot of magic involved. There were so many moments when it could have gone the wrong way and it didn't. And so I don't think of, I don't think luck is the word that I would use. I would say that we dove in a hundred percent and we made that commitment and the universe supported us. And it's always a team effort between what we do in this physical world and making sure that the message that we're sending to, to the other realm is that we really want this, we're really committed to it, and we're gonna do whatever it takes to make it happen. Because when you do that, the rest of the world, the other, the invisible realm lines up behind you to make it happen.","Success is attributed to a combination of hard work, commitment, and the support of the universe and the invisible realm.",2,8,5

Etsy,"Yeah, such a great question. How much of it is under my control, which is my own hard work, and how much of it is out of my control, which is luck, and the older I get, the more it feels like there's at least one other force in play, the kind of karmic force or providence or whatever. So without all of these different forms of luck of being born in the United States, of being born in a middle-class family of this really strange path that I took through school of literally handing my rent check to my landlord when he happened to be holding a piece of paper to make a proposal for a website. Like how can you look at that and not think it's both luck and some form of providence? So I think that's the prerequisite. And then all the hard work is what follows.

KiwiCo,"Yeah, certainly when I think about the cards that I've been dealt, I consider myself to be very, very lucky in many ways. But I also think that sometimes luck implies a level of like passivity or, or kind of chance. And I'm a big believer in the notion of making things happen versus things happening to me.

It was the proclivities of, of our ultimate acquirer and the fact that we've both come, you know, from some, some means, right?

Or you can be a log and let it take you wear a may or you can fight it and swim upstream and exhaust yourself.

But I also believe that the universe has a power and an energy of its own. Some of it not in our control.

And I really believe that, I mean, you can have all the talent in the world, but if you don't work hard, it will all go to waste. And I think we've had a lot of counterintuitive decisions along the way, going to LA as our second market, buying a company three times our size that was struggling and converting it. People used to ask me like, you know, the baseball analogy, what inning are you in? And you say, well, we're in the early innings, but I still think we're coming outta the dugout. Look, I think that anytime you're successful in life, you gotta get lucky. I mean, I was lucky that that banker walked through my door, but he saw the hard work that we put into that restaurant and that's why he gave us that loan. I was lucky enough to meet Brett, but all along the way, we've had so much help. I, I in no way take credit for anything that has happened in the last 16 years.

People have, you know, busted their ass, growing these restaurants, building these restaurants, doing a lot of the heavy lifting. I get a lot of the credit people come and thank me all the time and say, your restaurant's amazing. What you do is amazing.

Affirm,"That's a great question. I've, I've heard you asked this before. And I, I thought, what is my answer? And came up with very little canned, anything, you know, I think the role of luck is vastly underappreciated. I think the action you take when an opportunity appears is yours, and it's the choice and willingness to take the risk and decision to just go for it and sort of damage your dose sort of moment. But if you are unwilling to move or unable to recognize, or don't encounter these moments of opportunity, you know, it's probably not available to you. And I, I feel a certain degree of guilt that some brilliant people I know may not have had some of these moments and they, they could have been much more successful than they are. And yet I do think that probably moments of luck appear in front of most of us at some point or another in our lives. And what do you do after once you see one of those have one of those, it does come down to work ethic and just willingness to grind, then sleep less and compromise things like work-life balance, which have their own consequences. It's not free and it can be very damaging, but luck is the kickstart.","Success is a combination of luck and hard work, with luck being the kickstart and hard work being essential to seizing opportunities.",6,8,3
Xero Shoes,"That is an excellent question. So I would say I can't really break it down that way because it's sort of a hundred percent luck and a hundred percent hard work and, but it's really a hundred percent luck. Yeah. There's so many things. You know, if Chris McDowell had never written that book, if Steven wasn't an internet marketer, if he and I didn't have complimentary skillsets, I, I would never have been able to create this business without him. He would never have been able to create this business without me. So without luck, you know, there, there are just so many ways this could never have happened or had a premature demise. First of all, when I listen to your show, this is my favorite part because this is something that I think people over, well look, we know from psychological research, people over at value their own role and things that go well and undervalue it and things that go badly. When I was in film school, one of our teachers was the now late director of Mueller Foreman and someone said to him one day, how do you make a good movie? And pardon my bad check accent, milish Mueller said, well, making good movies, he's 90% casting. And as the other 10% is also casting. And so that's how I think of business. It's 90% luck and the other 10% is also luck. And then just like Lena said, there's a whole separate a hundred percent where it's 90% working your butt off and the other 10% hopefully being smart enough or finding someone smart enough to know how to put out the fires that started overnight despite the fact that nothing changed since yesterday. Yeah. So, you know, hopefully with a little gratitude, humility and not trying to reinvent a wheel that put itself together in ways that I can't imagine, it's gonna be interesting to see what happens next.","Success is attributed to a combination of luck, hard work, and the people around them.

But I think we, we worked our tails off, especially in that first year. Just obsessing over everything. Yeah. I mean, I don't know.

Of course, of course they do but the reality is that I think most of the success that I've had is been because of luck. I was lucky enough to be born where I was born. At a time that I was that I was born in I haven't have certain skills that those skill sets may not have been worth much a thousand years ago. I don't know if I would have been a great hunter or a great farmer. So it's really luck that is allowed me to be in the position that I'm in.

The Ringer,"I think there's a third factor that's the most important. I always try to challenge myself really. Starting in 2006, when 2006 started, I was like, I don't wanna leave 2006 in the exact same position I was in in 2005. And I think I've stuck to that really for 16 years now, where every single year I wanted to look back at the end of the year and be like, oh, this is the year this happened. Yeah. Like especially with content and creativity, like if you're just running it back every year, that's not sustainable and eventually people are gonna pass you and you're gonna be on the outside looking in. So I think once I realized that, that helped me the most, I think some of it was hard work and talent and then the luck piece. Like I think to just be like, oh you were lucky. Like what does that mean? Like I worked my ass off for every single thing that happened. I don't, I don't understand how luck factors into that for the most part.

I think it helps you not pat yourself on the back too hard when things go right while at the same time not getting too hard on yourself when things don't go right. Some things are just out of your control and luck is definitely one of them. I think the older I get, I'm not sure if I believe in luck as much, but I definitely believe that there's something out of your control, some sort of divine help.

Are you willing to walk away from everything to pursue it? You know, and I see my job seriously as just listening to your employees and your partners in the business and, and coming to an agreement. So we're all focused on the same goal line and showing the growth and sharing in the growth. You know, all my senior staff and many of my employees have stock in the company. So they're motivated to help grow. It's just doing the right thing for people doing the right thing in life. And, you know, having the willpower and the strength to take the chance.","Success is attributed to a combination of luck, hard work, and surrounding oneself with the right people.",4,6,5
Bonobos,"Luck is a concept that I thought of in a straightforward way for a while. And then when I converted to Judaism last February, I became acquainted with this concept of kismet, which is, I don't even pronouncing it right, probably, but it's kind of the intersection of luck and serendipity. And maybe even some measure of destiny. I don't want to go that far because I still don't know why really bad things happen to good people. So I think you've gotta be open in life to the way that the universe is trying to help you. The people who love you, who if you just listened to them and cultivate relationships with people who are direct will tell you what you need to hear. If it's not what you want to hear the same thing at accompany, the people along the way, your board, your investors, your employees, who know as a collective, what to do more so than you, but in combination. And you can unlock that. So I think if you bring self-awareness and you bring empathy and you bring positivity and you bring intellectual honesty and courage, you ultimately try to make good decisions. I think you can influence a lot, but I would attribute this outcome in this company at the end of the day to three things, to the quality of the people around me on all fronts, to the hard work of those people who, who really believed in this and made this happen, the team, and then a healthy, healthy dose of self-awareness in the pursuit of, of kismet. I am. I think that the two things that you're the two really big things that influence your life, the family that you're born into. And I don't know what I call it, that your DNA, the genetic stock, who, you know, who, how you show up as a creature, as a human being, you have no control over those two things. And so I feel like in life I was dealt. If we call it luck, you know, I don't want to say pocket ACEs. Cause I don't know what, how to think about my genetic makeup, but I was born into the most incredible family ever. And I was given the best of all opportunities, wanting for nothing educationally or experientially, the best mom, the best at the best sister. Now I've got the best wife. So with all that and all the amazing groups of people I've been around, I owe it to everyone to do something akin to this. And at the end of the day, the credit goes to them in so many ways.","Success is attributed to a combination of luck, hard work, and the quality of the people around them.

Numi Organic Tea,"I mean, I would say a lot of hard work, a lot of hard work. I mean, from when we started 30, I was 31. Those first 10 years was, you know, wake up at six, seven, stop working in 11 work on the weekends, demoing at stores, going to different events. It was just constant. You know, I think we had a lot of good breaks. You know, the Tazo was a great break. You know, we got a lot of good press hits. One time we were on the cover of a natural foods, publication that all of a sudden got us distributors. So we had a lot of good breaks. We were lucky because you know, our father helped us and he, he had worked hard and had made money. So it was a combination. Yeah. Oh man, I bet you, I mean, I'd say hard work is it took a lot of hard work. It took the first three, four or five years of 90, a hundred hour work weeks. Yeah. There were definitely some lucky moments that really helped us. And a lot of angels surrounded us. And I think those angels surrounded us because they cared. They saw what new means essence was about and they wanted to see us succeed. So to have those kinds of people with us that really believe in the journey, believe in the mission. I wouldn't say that's luck. I wouldn't even say it's hard work. I would say it's just an force that new me has been able to bring it's now its own living creature.

Tatcha,"for sure not intelligence. I am no smarter than anybody else. I think when you start any company, the most important thing is to show up every day. You just you just have to you just have to keep showing up for the game. I did get very very very blessed with amazing people who believed in us when there was nothing to believe in and who stayed with us. So our scientists from day one or solar scientists today are packaging Partners from day one are still our packaging Partners today our Retail Partners Sephora who did Believe in Us in day one. I just couldn't afford to be with him until year five because it requires more investment. They're our best partners. Today so I I've been really blessed but I'm definitely not smarter.

Primary,"Definitely a combination. I think examples for us of what has felt really lucky are, I mean, first of all, just meeting the right partner. A lot of people would like an amazing partner, but they're like, how do I find one? And, and you know, sometimes when you want to find one, you can't just go find one. And I think those moments that that hit you, that make you, that are just the spark of an idea. I mean those are just lucky moments. The fact that Galen's girls couldn't find the orange jackets, as annoying as that was at the time, was the, the spark, you know, of an idea that I don't know if we would've come to otherwise. And at the same time, I think we would certainly say in e-commerce in particular, if anyone thinks it's glamorous, it just isn't. And to be successful in e-commerce, I mean it is just a lot of grinding it out, a lot of like blocking and tackling how many more cliches can I use? It just, it just is. And so I think that there's no way that an enormous amount of hard work isn't necessary to be successful in this industry. I think we've just learned too how important timing is to whether something can work or not. And so I think probably on balance, I lean a little more luck as the answer. And I think too, so many founders and companies have like worked so hard and had a good idea and been really smart about it, but it just didn't quite work. And so I think, yeah, there's a little bit of like, we've, we've been lucky on the timing and some of the decisions that we happen to get right? 'cause I think the, the difference between like a company that makes it and a company doesn't often comes down to something like really small. So feel very lucky to be where we are.","Success is attributed to a combination of luck, hard work, and timing.

WordPress & Automattic,"You have to work really hard, you know, and what I got from my dad, it's just, I'm going to work harder and I'm going to be impeccable. And WordPress started.

I was working on something that I would want to do, even if I had all the money in the world. And every course, and a lot of the stories we talked about, there was a lucky break. I was very lucky to be introduced to Tony Schneider, who was like an amazing for CEO of the company. I was lucky to have investors that like supportive of us, doing things differently and building something a different way than all the other companies at the time.

Dude Perfect,"We are perfectionists, right? We all are. And we are all willing to put in that extra effort and whatever piece of the process you can imagine. I mean, just the other day, as an example, we launched a new book recently. And so we did kind of a contest giveaway, and we did this big film project in order to make it happen. And we put a lot of time and effort into it and we edited it and we looked at it and we said, I don't like the way it looks like it's okay. No one would really bat an eye at it, but that's not the vision that we had. And we, we went and we redid the whole thing. Right. So that's just so classic dude. Perfect. We have this bar that I think is a lot higher than what most people imagine. It would be at least online. So on the hard work side, I mean, I'm not gonna lie. Like we, you know, we try hard, we take it seriously. It's the most fun thing ever. So we don't take it too seriously, but we take the opportunity that we have with it seriously. And you know, if we can spread a little bit of hope and joy in that sense, that's a huge win. How about you telling, I mean, there's no question that we've all put in a, a lot of work, but I think we would still be putting in that work. I mean, I was putting in that work when I was doing landscaping, our personalities have always like, the way we were raised is, you know, you've got to work for, for something it's not just going to be handed to you. And so I think we tend to look at it, maybe not so much of luck, but more so that God has blessed us with this platform for a reason. And even if it's just as simple as providing content for families to sit down and watch together, I think we, we hope it minimum. Like that's what we can provide for people. And I don't tend to look at it as luck, but I think it's been a huge blessing to be able to have a platform like that. I mean, it would be a waste if at the end of this, it was like, oh, okay, well, we made some funny videos on this website called YouTube that may or may not be around in 50 years.

And so that kind, like, they're all tied, right? They're all to me like so tied together. I even think, you know, like my birth order has a big impact on what you end up doing. Like I was the last child, you know, in my siblings were all born right in a row. And then there was a five year break, and then I was born. And so like, I mean, the joke in the family is that I was the mistake, but because my parents had sort of been done with parenting, they took much. I was sort of like, this kind of fun, oh right, you know, parenting is fun and it's interesting and now we have more time to pay attention to you.

Politico & Axios,"I just feel like people don't credit luck enough. That's why, why I hate the great man stories. These one person visionaries who willed something into existence that's bullshit. Like nobody wills something into existence alone. You have a lot of people who are helping you, who've helped you in the past, who are helping you in real time to do the impossible. And I don't think people appreciate luck of just being in the right place at the right time of having an idea that works now, that might not work tomorrow or might not have worked yesterday of running into the right co-founder. Like if I don't ask Jen Hurley, who's was working in our finance department about where she's going and she had not told me, oh, I'm going skiing with this guy Roy Schwartz, who's really interesting and you should talk to him about business. He's just a smart guy. Like that's pure luck. Like how did I have that conversation with her? And she pointed me to Roy, if we didn't have Roy Schwartz, Axio wouldn't have existed. Hmm. Or how do I end up on the Lido deck in Genoa, Italy during the trade protest when I'm working at the Wall Street Journal and I turn to the person next to me at 4:00 AM who looks at me and says with his beer in his hand for speed. And it's Mike Allen wanting to see who can slam a beer faster and starts a lifelong friendship. How do we have a spark of an idea to start Politico?

I was lucky to be born to parents who are entrepreneurs, you know who taught me the power of hard work and positive thinking and doing the right thing. I was born in a country and a society that values education for girls and I went to Great Schools and I have a network of friends who supported me on this journey and the power of timing was so lucky, you know, I started swell because I had a personal mission to eliminate single-use plastic bottles, but at the same time, I started the company there were so many people around the world waking up to the issue of climate change and global warming and how they potentially had the need to take personal action.

Health-Ade Kombucha,"It's definitely not zero luck, the initial number that came up was 20% luck. That's what I wanted to say. I would say it's 80% grit. There's definitely moments of blessings. You know that ride along with Vanessa, Health-Ade would not be where it is without Vanessa. That is a blessing, you know the phone call from the farmers market just when we needed investment, the guy that chose to buy a Health-Ade and called us and said we wanted to invest, many of those types of things are hard to explain and there's more of that.

And when it just seemed like it was impossible, we've managed to find a different solution and keep on going a little bit and you need that. And if we've had any luck, if I've had any luck personally, I mean, I think we've been given an enormous leg up with our families and with our mom and dad and now with our wives and that was a loving household, that valued education that encouraged us to go and take risks and do what we wanted to do. And not everyone has that. And it's been an enormously important part of the journey because I think we've leaned on them right now. I have at key moments, very, very heavily to keep on going. Yeah, I think they're inextricably linked. I've always thought of luck as some random event happening to you, but that happens. And then what are you gonna do with it? And I think we've had the good fortune together to have great timing across a whole host of things. Like we could start a business and put up a website in seven months and reach 10,000 people in a week. But we also seized and capitalized on that opportunity and we worked super hard and made some good decisions along the way to turn that luck into something that was really positive.

We went out and researched product, but then led us to my godfather, which then, you know, so I think a lot of certainly Locke that played in part to, you know, the moment in time in which we formed this company to, all the fortuitous events that have led us here.

Bluemercury,"The idea that we don't realize that the success that we've had at Blue Mercury is really a sequential set of miracles. If we were to say that we didn't realize that it, it wouldn't be fair and that we looked back, I think during our journey and said if these sort of five things didn't go right, if we didn't meet Invis, we didn't raise that initial capital.

Michael Kors,"I'm, I'm not a believer in luck in the traditional sense of the word. I believe in hard work. I believe in experience, I believe in curiosity, but my version of luck is how do you make sure that you leave yourself open to possibility? I've always been curious about, and, and never limited myself about what could be next. Yeah. You know, whether it was leaving school when I was 19 years old and saying, let me start working, starting my own business with no experience running and, and figuring out how to go to Italy and sign this license, get out of chapter 11 and deal with that and move forward.

Ring,"So the thing I always say about luck, I think it is, it's the lottery, and so you get sort of lottery tickets for how, you know, it's like how good your idea is, how good your team is, and how hard you work. And so you take those like factors, and I think how hard you work and your team are probably even bigger factors than the idea, but you still need to have something that actually would work. And so you take those three things together, and you get, for each sort of hour of production or work, you get a lottery ticket. And so, just like the lottery, if you, unless you own every ticket, you're not guaranteed to win because I've seen people that are smarter than me, better than me, better idea than me fail because of things like luck, like things not going their way. And I've seen again the opposite of that. And so we have been fortunate to have been have lots of lucky breaks in our direction, but we also continue to work to get more tickets so that we could win the lottery.","Success is attributed to a combination of luck, hard work, and having a good team.

I was able to just like pay another rent to my colon so that I could keep making videos. And that was just, that's just not an opportunity for a lot of people. So like even those little things, those little pieces of luck, it's so hard to see them sometimes. Yeah. Like I can't even attribute it to skill because I'm not even that strategic. I just sort of go towards what's working. Yeah. That was, I thought that was a really interesting answer Hank, because like there have been a few moments in our career where we didn't like fly blindly toward the light, like moths at night for reasons we didn't understand.
