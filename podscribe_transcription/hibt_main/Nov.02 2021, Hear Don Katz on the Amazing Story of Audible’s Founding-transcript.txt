Guy Raz (17s):
So you guys go public and the fall of 1999, and by the spring of 2000, the.com bubble burst, it could have crashes. Yeah, there were 1500 public internet companies at the beginning of 2000, and 140 at the beginning of 2003. But it was that kind of, you know, of decimation and the stock price, which was one $29 or something. It went down to $0.04 cents at the end of 2000.

Guy Raz (1m 2s):
$0.04 cents! [Music Intro for How I Built This]. From NPR, it's How I built this - a show about innovators, entrepreneurs, idealists, and the stories behind the movements they built. I'm guy Raz. And on the show today, how in the era of cluggy cassette tapes, Don Katz created a whole new kind of audio experience online on demand with Audible Back in the mid 1990s. Back before you could plug in a pair of earbuds and choose from hundreds of thousands of different books, millions of different podcasts or tens of millions of different songs back before any of that.

Guy Raz (1m 49s):
A former journalist turned writer named Don Katz had a problem during his daily jog in New York city. He would listen to books on tape, literally Han tape as in cassette tapes and Dom wondered, why do I have to lug around a cassette player? And then flip the cassette decide be in the middle of my run. Surely there must be an easier way he thought. And in fact, at the time there was MP3 technology existed, except almost no one used it in the mid 1990s, compact disc sales were on a tear. It would take another seven years before CDs began to decline, but Don was optimistic.

Guy Raz (2m 33s):
And at the age of 42, he decided to ditch his successful career as a writer and try to start something. He knew nothing about a tech company, a company that would create a digital audio catalog of books and storytelling and spoken word and deliver those stories to users through a device specially designed to play that audio. And as you will hear in the early, not many people came to the party. The technology was way ahead of its time. Probably *too* ahead of its time. In fact, Audible, the company Don founded almost collapsed in the early two thousands when its stock price hovered at around 4 cents a share.

Guy Raz (3m 18s):
But today, of course, Audible holds the biggest audio book catalog in the world. It dominates the space with a library of over 600,000 titles. And the company is now part of the Amazon family, which bought Audible for $300 million in 2008. But getting to that point was painful and full of setbacks. And the story includes a cameo appearance from none other than Steve jobs. Don Katz was a staff writer for rolling stone magazine during its heyday in the late seventies and eighties. He grew up in Chicago in the fifties and sixties and strongly identified with his dad who owned a small business.

3 (4m 1s):
So my father was just incredibly kind of smart kind and you know, it's a cliche, but he was one of these guys. You would want it to be your best friend. I looked up to him. I probably wished he was home more because he was frankly like I became someone who worked a lot and he was also, he'd been a war hero. He ran away from home basically 17 and was, was behind enemy lines, highly decorated

Guy Raz (4m 36s):
Italy, or, or

3 (4m 37s):
It was in the, he was in the black forest in Germany, you know, and he didn't really talk about it. He wasn't one of those guys, but he had different purple hearts. Every time I broke a leg in hockey or something, I would find I would wake up and find the purple heart on my pillow.

Guy Raz (4m 52s):
And, and, and your dad, from what I understand, he hit a music store in Chicago called I guess called K musical instruments. And it was,

3 (4m 59s):
It was actually a guitar man,

Guy Raz (5m 1s):
Your guitar, many veteran.

3 (5m 2s):
Yeah. My dad made make guitars. He made them for Sears, silver tones, but I remember that there were some pretty great bands of the era and one called spirit that had a fantastic guitarist named Randy, California, who only would play, play Ks. And the like, but, but my dad's kind of claim to fame at that time was that he put chord books in guitars and started this whole idea that you two can play the guitar. And it alienated a lot of the musicians, including Barney Kessel and Les Paul and people that he was friends with because they were infuriated to say that their instrument was any more easier to play than Australia than it than a violin.

3 (5m 46s):
And of course he said, yeah, but you know, it is. And so it ended up that my family was all in Newsweek magazine taking our guitar lessons together because my dad had, had decided to part of this YouTube can play the guitar, which was part of the whole mid sixties folk music kind of kind of movement. So, so I think back, and he was definitely somebody who also liked to challenge the status quo, which I think I have come by honestly.

Guy Raz (6m 12s):
So was he financially successful?

3 (6m 15s):
He was financially successful in the way of a rising entrepreneur of his time, but very tragically. He went out to play tennis at 47 years old on a Saturday. And I got a call when I was in college saying that he died playing tennis, very suddenly of a massive heart attack. And it really marked my life in so many ways. It was definitely, you know, a formative experience I I've heard. And you probably have heard this too, that there's a lot of patterns of fatherlessness in highly entrepreneurial people, whether it's through abandonment or, or early death, including taking ridiculous risks as a journalist in the early part of my career, where I could have easily gotten, gotten killed several times.

3 (7m 9s):
I think I was working out his heroism and other kinds of things. So, you know, you come to these things a little later in life, but it is interesting to reflect on it.

Guy Raz (7m 17s):
So, so for college, I know that that you went to NYU and you majored in English. And from what I understand, Ralph Ellison, like the Ralph Ellison, the invisible man, Ralph Ellison was a professor there. And, and you kind of had an opportunity to sort of work with him to be tutored by him,

3 (7m 37s):
Right? He, he, he taught me how to read and Jorge that I, I fully didn't understand. And I knew that I loved more than anything, the, the sound of literature and I was just in how it felt to me, but I, Ralph actually kind of flushed it out in a way that it became something that I was fully able to understand. He also, he also gave me the, I think the confidence to try to be a professional writer, which I proceeded to do for, for 20 years

Guy Raz (8m 8s):
Was, was, was Ralph Ellison, your like your thesis advisor?

3 (8m 12s):
Yeah, he basically was, and Ralph was a deep and exacting intellectual. So I had to work really hard and, and read really hard anyway. So it was, it was an amazing experience. He, he would sit with a big Stokey and he had this amazing story telling voice with this. Oklahoma I've said that his voice was like a cold car coming out of my mind and I would just be mesmerized. And, and he was a big supporter. And, you know, later, even the Audible transition, right at the time he died, he was incredibly supportive of what I did.

Guy Raz (8m 53s):
So you graduate from, from NYU and you're sort of thinking that you want to be a writer, but it's not that easy to do. So. And you did what lots of people do, which is you decide to go to graduate school, to continue studying. I I'm assume you went to London to the London school of economics. Yeah. I might. Am I assuming correctly that you didn't really know what you wanted to do? You wanted to kind of buy some time?

3 (9m 19s):
Absolutely. In fact, I thought at the time, almost everybody thought if he didn't know what you should do, you should go to law school. Yes. But I studied the European economics and politics and international history. And I was living with my old friend, Barbara, who was a rock writer. She had gone to be a rock and roll writer in London. And so we just paired up and shared a flat. And so I would come home and there would be, you know, rod Stewart and Keith Richards. And, and so that's who she hung out with. Wow.

Guy Raz (9m 55s):
And your roommate, Barbara, this is somebody you knew from college,

3 (9m 59s):
From high school,

Guy Raz (9m 60s):
From high school. Well,

3 (10m 1s):
And just to make money, Barbara got me a little gigs reviewing albums for the British Exactly new musical express sounds. And I I'll never forget. I wrote one about Frankie Valli and the four seasons I got to interview Frankie Valli and the like, and I was just kinda trying to, trying to figure it out. I matriculated for a PhD, but I just didn't know, you know, what I wanted to do.

Guy Raz (10m 30s):
All right. So you're, you're doing a little writing and kind of getting into the music scene in London. And, and I guess one night you're out at dinner and you meet a guy who winds up kind of launching your career in internal ism. W what's the story?

3 (10m 45s):
Absolutely sitting next to a guy named Robert Greenfield who introduces himself as a rolling stone writer. And we just get chatting. And I basically told him about some of the things that were going on, notably, what was going on in Spain at the end of Franco. And I talked to him about what was going on in Northern Ireland, because I had a very different perspective on the world because I was based in London and in reading the European press. And he said, you know, you should package one of these things. And right, this guy, Yon winter, who I worked with at rolling stone, a letter with some ideas, because you could, you could just, you know, write about these are great stories you've got.

3 (11m 27s):
And I went ahead and I sat down and I wrote this letter, the two or three ideas.

Guy Raz (11m 32s):
It's definitely just a handwritten letter or typed letter that you write.

3 (11m 35s):
No, no, I tell you, I tried

Guy Raz (11m 36s):
To let it be on when I'm

3 (11m 38s):
Right, right. I might type

Guy Raz (11m 40s):
Pitch an idea for an article, which was what, what did you write in the letter? What was the pitch?

3 (11m 44s):
One of them was that, that at the point, Franco who was ancient begins to die, the great dictator of Spain, it would be very interesting to aluminate the liberation movement of the Atia Basque, separatists, and the perspective of this last dictator going down. And that basically the last of the world war two era, you know, dictators. And it wouldn't be an interesting story. And I get a telegram saying, go to Spain and I'm not so sure anyone I work with at Audible or my children know what a telegram even looks like, because that's, that was the fast way to get to me. It was to say, get it, get out of here, go, go, go write the story.

3 (12m 26s):
And it basically said, right, you know, write five to 7,000 words and we'll pay you $1,500 and reasonable expenses.

Guy Raz (12m 35s):
This sounds like a, this sounds like a dispatch from hunter Thompson, right? He would say, oh, and reasonable expenses from beyond winter. But I mean, you get this, you get this telegram from him. Just curious, did you have a mild panic attack because you were 23 and rolling stone was hugely influential by that point,

3 (12m 52s):
The attack that actually, I think attacks all people who go way out with crazy ideas, whatever they are at, which is that, oh my God, I'm a fraud. And they're about to find out exactly exactly what happened, but it's not the only time of my life that, you know, I've, I've had that feeling. So I had no idea what to do. And I got myself to Madrid. I knew I'd have to get basically credentialed to cover what was supposed to be a funeral. And so what happened was all of the, of the world war two era journalists who were still around the wire service guys, they all descended on Madrid for almost like a last hurrah.

3 (13m 34s):
And they took me under their collective wing and showed me a whole lot of stuff about how to be a more traditional journalists. And I sat down and I wrote this story and it came out as I'd written it. And on the cover, it said dispatch from the valley of the fallen, with my name on it on rolling stone magazine. Now I'm 23 years old. And I was like, I can't believe this. And of course, because I really hadn't been a student journalist. I just wrote, you know, I didn't know that as it was explained to me later that usually they like to edit these things a lot, but they sure they didn't, they just put it in.

Guy Raz (14m 22s):
And so I guess you want me to start writing more and more pieces for rolling stone and eventually some, some other publications and any sorts of travel, more like to Northern Ireland. And I think you went to Ethiopia and a bunch of different war zones, but I mean, you were, you were in crowds, so incredibly young when you were getting those post by-lines, I read a story and I, I love the story that you were. So self-conscious about being like quote found out that, you know, that cause you were so young that whenever one of, one of your American editors would come to London, you would actually not be there deliberately like you. So you wouldn't have to meet them face to face.

3 (15m 3s):
I thought if they saw how young I think I looked like I was 12 when I was 23 years old, I, I was incredibly self-conscious and I did try to be out on assignment when the editors I was working with, you know, telephonically or in town for awhile. And eventually when I revealed myself and I met them, they did exactly what I expect. This is, oh, come on. You're you're not done. Like they, they were incredulous that I was putting out this precocious stuff.

Guy Raz (15m 34s):
Yeah. I imagine, I, I guess you stayed in Europe for, for several years. And I guess by like the late seventies, you moved to New York to work at rolling stone and, and you, I think, and I think you also got married around then, how did you meet your wife?

3 (15m 52s):
I met my wife, Leslie in 1982, on a river raft trip in Pennsylvania, out of Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania. And we were both with different people and we kind of hit it off. And I went off to China for national geographic and spent a little bit months traveling the silk road. It was incredible trip, but it was long. And when I got back, the relationship with my former girlfriend was over and she said to me, I know who you're going to call on other people's that last night and that she was writing

Guy Raz (16m 34s):
Because you had connected with her on that, on that river trip.

3 (16m 38s):
Definitely. I thought she was great. So, so, and, and, and life went on from there and it's been an amazing marriage and just about nothing I can think of that that has been good for me. She hasn't been an amazing part of including memorably referring to my sudden, you turn from writer to entrepreneur as a non-toxic midlife crisis,

Guy Raz (17m 5s):
Which will, which we'll get to in, in a, in a moment. But I mean, at that time you were still a journalist for rolling stone. You got this great job you're getting paid in salary. When did you, I know that you, you wrote your first book, which was the story of Sears that the department store, I guess, the history of Sears and then kind of like the rise and fall of it. And the book came out in like 87. Why did you want to write a book about Sears?

3 (17m 33s):
Well, I kind of thought how weird would it be to take this, you know, this hippie counter culture, storytelling and write about a big old American company. Hey, what happened to it? And I wrote another letter. I wrote a letter to the CEO and chairman of Sears, a guy named ed telling who is famous for never having, given an interview, completely introverted guy. The beat reporters couldn't get anything out of ed telling. And basically I said that if he, if he can deal with the great American corporation of the 20th century changing itself. So as to continue to be the most beloved and trusted company of the century, it's a matter of historical record.

3 (18m 20s):
And he just decided that he'd let me in. And this was really rare because as you all know, corporations tend to be, you know, Pentagon like, and their control over, over the truth. And so I proceeded to show up as a bearded, still looking quite young guy and people who worked at Sears decided I was okay because I had sold at telling on something. They never thought anybody would sell. And so I was a salesman in their eyes and I just tried, you know, I spent, he hears on this. Wow. And did I get an MBA in real time?

Guy Raz (19m 1s):
I'm wondering if ed telling, because he was widely reviled by the business press, right? He was considered to be a disastrous leader in the end. One could argue he, he redeemed himself. But do you think that he wanted you to write this book? So he would come out being redeemed?

3 (19m 20s):
I think he wanted to be part of history. I think he like so many of these serious guys who they came and transferred their battlefield loyalties from world war two to this Heartland corporation. They lived these lives where they would move 14, 16 times. I mean, that was part of a corporate life in those days. Yeah. But boy, it was a, it was a pretty epic test to then turn it into this, you know, this tale of America, but it was a tale of hubris. It was a tale of the final founders sowing the seeds of the destruction of the company. I have a whole chapter. I remember in there about the building of the Sears tower. They made this genius conception of every customer thought Sears was the friendly guy down the street, the member of the Kiwanis club.

3 (20m 8s):
And that series was this localized reality. And once they built that tower and said that they're one of the most powerful companies in the world, all the bad stuff started happening because it was just thought to be such a, you know, an unfortunate statement of live of their purpose. But that company's story is, is very much about the, the, the end of the, what ended up happening in the seventies. Eighties is Americans realized that other countries actually sometimes were even more productive than they were. And all those, all that wake-up call was part of that story.

Guy Raz (20m 44s):
You are a runner, right? Or we're a runner or, well,

3 (20m 49s):
I'm a hockey player who runs or did run a lot. So as to keep in shape, but I definitely liked to run in my, and my regimen when I was living in New York, as a writer was to take off in Riverside park and run several miles at the end of the day.

Guy Raz (21m 8s):
And while you ran, what would you listen to music?

3 (21m 12s):
Well, I ran with a partner and we would just chat the whole time, or I listened to the early audio books

Guy Raz (21m 21s):
On cassette

3 (21m 22s):
And cassette

Guy Raz (21m 24s):
Walkman

3 (21m 24s):
Painful. It was a, at a Sony Walkman in a belly pack knocking around. And I just remember the utter irritation of trying to change the tapes when you're aerobically taxed and, and how, because you rent it, I'm in these big brown boxes that they would often not work at all, which was really irritating when you were a couple of miles from home. But I remember listening to, you know, John reads 10 days that shook the world. I would take on these long, you know, kind of books and, and jog along and listen. But at that point I was the only person I knew who, who did that.

Guy Raz (22m 2s):
Okay. So I think this is the early 1990s. And during this time, I guess you're, you're also researching another book, which I think it was a book about like the burgeoning tech industry. Yeah. So at what point were you like, wait, I'm, I might have a business idea here. Like how did, how did that happen?

3 (22m 22s):
So, so I, I had this book contract. I, I began to connect with people who were teaching me what I didn't know about the technology. And one of the people who was my key contacts was my college roommate from NYU ed Lough, one of my close friends to this day who was a computer frigging genius. And we were talking about signal compression, basically about analog to digital signal compression. And I was asking all these questions about how text fit through the internet, which was wait for it, the phone lines, there was no broadband at all.

3 (23m 5s):
And these discussions were happening in 93, 94. And he had this thought, he said, you know, you know, you could, you could get voice through the phone line. It could be compressed. And we went back and forth. And I said, pat, you know, if you could take audio books and send them through the, the phone line, the cost of the, of the packaging and all those tapes, wouldn't be there. You could lower the cost. I don't remember saying we liberate the signal, meaning how do we get the audio into my belly pack? You know, so I can watch a quick go around with it. And we're, how are we going to get it into cars?

3 (23m 46s):
Is that's where people have, have a lot of time. I remember thinking if you took these audio books, you could actually liberate time for people. And we got kind of more excited about it. And I got more and more interested in what it would mean to do this because no one else was doing it.

Guy Raz (24m 6s):
Okay. So you're thinking of making some new type of digital device or like a system for playing audio. So w w what did you start to do?

3 (24m 14s):
So through out 1994, I spent time trying to find anyone I could find to talk about a future that involved these little devices that were filled with the sound, the soundscape of culture, basically the, the soundtrack of culture. I remember talking in various ways or the sound of civilization. I remember all these things coming out saying, can't you see it? And like people thought I was out of my mind. I mean, I couldn't find anybody who knew what I was talking about except for ed. And we just decided to write it up into a business plan,

Guy Raz (24m 52s):
To do a business plan, to create,

3 (24m 54s):
To create a company that we decided should be called Audible Words.

Guy Raz (24m 59s):
And it would be a company that made what books on tape that were digital.

3 (25m 5s):
Believe it or not guy, it was actually a solid state cassette. It was a cassette that you hooked to the phone line. That was the first path. And that the idea was you'd have the signal come over. You'd capture it in the cassette flash memory. You'd push it into the tape bed in your car, which instantly everybody had at that point. And you'd be able to listen, and we just played with it. But I have to tell you, I wrote the business plan and it was like 110 page narrative.

Guy Raz (25m 37s):
What was the story? It was a narrative saying what

3 (25m 41s):
The story was that we would occupy this time of people's life, which was, and we said, when your eyes are busy, but your mind is free. We would create a higher level of purpose that the AMF am radio was for everybody. It wasn't just for you. And you would be able to program your own listening time in the future, through digital technology. And that we would have a company that would sell a solid state digital device, as well as content. It would be about books and literature. It would allow you to listen to fresh air and marketplace, and all these shows that played at two o'clock in the afternoon.

3 (26m 27s):
And we got a patent together on a downloadable system of pro for media that would be captured by a solid state device. And I remember it was $14,000 that I put on my credit card. Wow. And cause, you know, what do we know now? I know of course, you know, without a portfolio, patents are worthless, but you know, at that point I didn't, that was the first thing we did, but we actually started to get really excited about that.

Guy Raz (26m 55s):
So, so instead of terrestrial radio, you could get it delivered through the internet instead of an audio book on tape or a book or a speech on tape or some kind of, you know, inspiring, I don't know, inspirational thing. You just basically say, this business is going to deliver this stuff to you through your phone line, to do the internet,

3 (27m 14s):
Play up the book part of it because the business itself was so infant testimonial and, and, and small. What I said, what I did was I realized through just basic journalistic research that 93 million Americans drove to work alone every morning, there were at that point only department of transportation number, which you could extrapolate to hundreds of millions of hours of time. People sit in traffic. I then matched the sociological data that showed that the most frustrating time of people's days and least valuable time is sitting in traffic. And I basically just, we said, if we only penetrate 9% of them at $10 a month for a service that enriched their lives, here's how big the business would be.

3 (28m 2s):
Right. And that's how we were able to get, you know, what's now very small amounts of money, but was then to us a lot of money to, to, to make Audible.

Guy Raz (28m 12s):
But before you went out to seek capital for this, right, cause you were writing a book, how did this idea just take over your mind and your life? Because all of us get ideas, we've all had a business idea. And sometimes it, it captures us for a week or two weeks, but this was really,

3 (28m 36s):
I think I, there were multiple things inspiring me at the time. One was, I just thought it was interesting that I daydreamed about this more than I was daydreaming about the next paragraph or the next day I was writing. The other thing was I kept going to people who I otherwise respected, who thought I was crazy.

Guy Raz (28m 57s):
They thought you were crazy because you had a great gig and you're respected. And

3 (29m 2s):
We were so dismissive of it. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it was like, they just didn't get it. I mean, even people who took the time said, why don't you just package it and try to sell it to Sony for $25,000, it might be something they're interested in. It was such a dismissive reaction to it. And that made me more inspired really to go ahead and try, try to do it. Yeah.

Guy Raz (29m 27s):
And we come back in just a moment. It turns out that building a new type of audio player and a new type of audio marketplace and a whole new type of audio experience is hard. And that's before the.com bust they with us, I'm guy Raz. And you're listening to how I built this from NPR, From wondering, call me curious as a podcast, hosted by Nikki Boyer that finally gives you definitive answers to life's burning questions.

Guy Raz (31m 2s):
Hey, welcome back to how I built this I'm guy Roz. So it's around 1995 and Don Katz is trying to build an audio player and platform for audio books, interviews, comedy, and more what will become Audible. But first he has to raise money. And one of the first people he calls is a former source from the world of tech, a guy named Tim Mott

3 (31m 26s):
And Tim ma was a great entrepreneur and is a great, great, great person. He was one of the founding people at electronic arts, the three people that developed electronic arts. And when Tim Mott read the primitive business plan, he called me up and said, I went fund this. This is amazing.

Guy Raz (31m 45s):
Don. When you went to your wife and you said, Hey, I want to do this. I want to start a business. What did, what was her reaction? Was she like, go for it?

3 (31m 54s):
I think at one point she said it was it's sounds a little sexist now, but she said it's better than a blonde. She'd already been such an amazing partner for someone who was willing to live without a net because, you know, I was freelance and book writer and everything, but I was scared. I mean, I, I had three kids at a market.

Guy Raz (32m 13s):
You were 43.

3 (32m 14s):
I was 43 years old and I took an 85% year over year pay cut to start Audible.

Guy Raz (32m 21s):
And meanwhile, from what I know of the story, you were looking for a business partner and you wanted it to be ed Lau. Who's your former, your former roommate, the guy who was that computer genius, but he wasn't able to join you. Right. So you, so you needed to find presumably someone else, right?

3 (32m 40s):
Yeah. I went out to find a new science partner and found my lifelong friend and wonderful person, guy story, who was a senior person at bell labs and guy decided to, you know, hear the siren song. And he joined me early. How

Guy Raz (32m 59s):
Did you convince him? How did you convince him? Or

3 (33m 2s):
Basically I basically said, I don't, I don't know if we're gonna overcome what a venture capitalists would call the tech risk, you know, and the execution risk, but whatever we build, we're going to put in front of consumers and you'll get to say that. And I said, you don't have to take the 85% year over year pay cut. I took, but you have to take 60 and you're going to get all these options. And a guy jumped into the Mary band,

Guy Raz (33m 27s):
Your initial backer, Tim Mott put in, I think like $400,000 in seed capital. Yep. And what did you know at the time about how to, you know, like how to deal with equity and valuations? I mean, now of course every company, it doesn't matter what the company is. It seems like their perceived level of valuation is $20 million. Oh, my company is valued at $20 million and you're like, what are you making nothing? We're giving ourselves a $20 million evaluation. How did you know how to do that and how to, you know, because

3 (34m 1s):
It literally trusted Tim and, you know, I was a fast study is journalists are. Yeah. So I was picking the stuff up and, and taking it in pretty quickly. And Tim's first round was, you know, allowed us to evolve the team. And we took over a doctor's office in Montclair, a single room, not far from where I'm speaking in New Jersey. And we paint, we painted it on a Sunday and moved in on a, on a Monday. So now we've moved out of my attic and had a place to, you know, to gather. And then Tim and I hit the road for California

Guy Raz (34m 39s):
To raise more money,

3 (34m 40s):
To raise more money, and also begin the process of building the first download system, the first way of actually securing the intellectual property. This was years before the terms about digital rights management were there because I'd had so many outside magazine articles ripped off on the Unix internet, and people put their own names on them. In the flake that I kind of had this idea that this kind of professional grade creativity might need to be protected. So a company very well known called IDEO, which does industrial design came in and they were totally excited about all this stuff and including everything from, you know, the idea of securing the IP and the download system and building a device with us.

3 (35m 25s):
So that process started. And yet we went out and spent a lot of time going up and down Sandhill road, getting to know people.

Guy Raz (35m 33s):
All right. So you're able to secure the capital. I think, I think I, a few million dollars to get an audio player built, but also, I mean, you've got to, you've got to get content for that audio player. And you were going to be the CEO of the company. You were going to manage people and manage a team. Is that right?

3 (35m 52s):
Yes. So I was president and CEO and Tim was chairman and we meet, we formed a board and I believe this idea of seeing the future and seeing these opportunities and doing something that had been done and persuading people to be part of it was the most important thing, but it is also true that managing people is a different art and science, which, but I did have all those years of watching both entrepreneurs and others lead.

Guy Raz (36m 23s):
Just to me, it just sounds incredibly overwhelming, like an overwhelming amount of things to do. I understand that you had written books about leaders, but you'd never had like a leadership position at any of the publications where you work. You weren't an editor at rolling stone. Were you nervous about becoming a manager of people in any way?

3 (36m 45s):
I was definitely nervous, but I was, I was on point, you know, look, I, I definitely felt more concerned about having put three and a half million dollars into play that was other people's money and feeling deeply responsible to them and to others, particularly people who left perfectly good jobs, because a lot of these people left really nice jobs to join this, this vision of the possible. So, yeah, it was incredibly stressful, but, but, but you did say that, you know, part of the thing was about getting the content. And I would argue that probably our original funders discounted how hard it was going to be to convince the gatekeepers of, of the content that existed to see this particular, you know, future.

Guy Raz (37m 35s):
What was the content that you envisioned being on this player? Because you had two paths, right? You're you, you, you got two things you gotta do at the same time. You've got one team building the actual device, that's going to play the stuff. And then presumably another team getting the content. So what, what did you think the content was going to be?

3 (37m 54s):
I thought the content would be frankly, what it, what it became a mixture of literally the best possible public expression. In words, you know, if the Churchill club had profound speeches, I wanted to carry that. If,

Guy Raz (38m 12s):
If

3 (38m 12s):
We, we, we turned the San Jose mercury news into an audio program

Guy Raz (38m 17s):
W you know, people reading the newspaper as, as content. Okay. So w what else, what else, what other kinds of content?

3 (38m 24s):
Well, we got some of your buddies at NPR, so we can have car talk or marketplace

Guy Raz (38m 31s):
Cartec, which was owned by those guys. So you didn't have to deal with NPR,

3 (38m 35s):
Right? 99 we'd S I'd signed up Robin Williams to do original programming for us. And yes, we wanted one of the audio books too, but it was many, many years. We had much more content that was just different kinds of public content,

Guy Raz (38m 53s):
Whatever you could get,

3 (38m 54s):
That we either narrated or other things before we had a lot of books, but the first download when it finally happened was in October 31st of 97, it was, men are from Mars and women are from Venus, the Ms self-help book. And I remember too, it was to a, a customer in cave Creek, Arizona. And that was, and it was done at that then pretty famous technology conference called the agenda conference, which is where we unveiled the service and gave everybody from, you know, bill gates to Steve jobs and Michael gel, this digital audio player we made.

3 (39m 35s):
And I'm sure the majority of them were sawed in half back in various labs. When people got home to see what's inside of them.

Guy Raz (39m 42s):
Th the idea was way ahead of its time. And often when that happens, businesses don't make it because they're too early, which I think

3 (39m 51s):
It's 95% of the time or something like that on the metrics. And we were, I think we were seven years before the vibrancy of the market. So it's a very unusual story to be alive that long.

Guy Raz (40m 6s):
So you have this device that comes out of 97, and how did the user experience this device? It was you buy this thing, it's an, a docking station. And then what you go to the Audible website, and there's a menu of things. You can get car talk, you can get the speeches from whatever the Commonwealth club, whatever it was. And you would all a cart by those things. And then they would download to this device that was connected to your computer, through a serial port. Am I describing this right,

3 (40m 36s):
Exactly. Right. That's how it worked. And now it did take a long time to come down. The internet was incredibly choppy over the phone lines before broadband. So we had really sophisticated resume features, which ended up being another things people celebrated for our tech chops later, because it would drop off. And that way, you know, it was always kind of waiting for you in the morning. And then you were supposed to drive to work and come home and put it back in the dock and get to work smarter than the guy in the next cube, as we used to say, and that was it. Now it should be said, it sounded like crap. I mean, the audio quality was not good.

3 (41m 18s):
It literally sounded like somebody talking to you with a COVID mask in the bottom of a bathtub or something. It was just not, it was not good audio, but we kept pushing the science forward. So guy and I would go around and visit these rocket scientists who develop codex and we would work with them.

Guy Raz (41m 41s):
The codex is, is I should say, I say, sure, cause I'm an audio, right?

3 (41m 44s):
But it's a, it's an, it's basically a software algorithm that th that deals with the compression factor of the audio and gives you, you know, relative sound clarity versus not. And we did push the labs out there to make much better sounding audio, you know, even month over month, that allowed us to the clarity to go up. But in the end, you know, the user experience was really clunky and primitive to the point that when I meet people who are original customers, I always say, I, we should have been paying you

Guy Raz (42m 18s):
Done. When you pitch this idea to investors, you talked about 93 million commuters people in their cars not using that time valuably. Well, this device was not designed for the car. So who was, when this came out in November of 1997, did you sell any of them? That was it successful?

3 (42m 39s):
We tend to sell many, but the people who got them, they did use them in their car. They just, they plugged them into a little speaker that said on their seat. They, we gave them a cassette converter that we had that. Would

Guy Raz (42m 56s):
You put that in your case

3 (42m 58s):
That remember that,

Guy Raz (42m 59s):
And then it would play out of your speakers and you could plug that into the output. Yeah,

3 (43m 3s):
But it costs us $208 to make that little device. And we tried to sell it for $215. Wow. And that was a lot of money for people to get something that, you know, was of that quality. And mostly that they didn't even understand what it was.

Guy Raz (43m 25s):
So, I mean, it comes out in 97 and this is your product that all these investment bankers, you know, venture capitalists put money in. And it sounds like it was a bomb.

3 (43m 37s):
It was kind of a, a bomb, but it didn't, we didn't ever stop to think that way. We just kinda went forward thinking like, what are we going to do now? And of course the tech deliverables were so difficult. I mean, I have to tell you being in the hardware business to this day, if it's not an easy business, does anyone who makes hardware will tell you, but I just remember missing a milestone that was a big milestone for another funding. And I get to this company called flex tronics, which is a very sophisticated contract in effect manufacturing company that was making the player. And I just said, what do you mean it's another three months.

3 (44m 17s):
He said, we're out of crystals. I said, what do you mean we're out of crystals? He said, do you know about crystals? I said, I think I know about Chrysalis. He said, well, Dan, you can't shit, a crystal, that's it. I had to grow them and to grow the frigging crystals

Guy Raz (44m 37s):
Crystals for the, for the liquid crystal,

3 (44m 39s):
Those were like traditional crystals that were in the, in the, you know, in the device. And it, you know, it couldn't believe how, you know, how complicated it was to get this thing built

Guy Raz (44m 51s):
Don at a certain point, I guess in the first years you ended up bringing on a guy named Andrew Huffman to become the CEO. And he, he died. I mean, 1999, he was just there for a couple of years. What?

3 (45m 6s):
Well, yeah. So Andy Huffman was a pure tech guy and, you know, really, really good guy, but he was absolutely pure product and tech guy. Yeah. And in that period, what I was doing, and now we're talking 99 was convincing by venture capitalists that they weren't the Cowboys anymore. Because what was going on was a bizarre situation in 98, 99, where companies like ours were going public and they were grabbing a whole lot of money. It was,

Guy Raz (45m 38s):
This was the boom. This was,

3 (45m 40s):
And it was very much a bubble, but it was a bubble that I did not want to miss because if nothing else, my London school of economics training is like, when capital it costs almost nothing. You probably should take it. So I just, we pushed forward.

Guy Raz (45m 56s):
You went to your, you went to your investors and you said, I want to go public.

3 (45m 60s):
Yeah. And then of course, you know, most of them said, what are you talking about? You know, you only have 3,800 customers. You know? So Robin Williams had come in and bought like 500,000 shares of common stock before it went public. He was part of the Roche. And he was cause he was real techie guy. And, and so it was a blast actually. And the whole thing of, of selling, of going to Europe and selling the site, there was a real experience.

Guy Raz (46m 27s):
And how did you do by the way, when you went public

3 (46m 30s):
Great, what we walked away with almost $40 million. We had 5,700 customers.

Guy Raz (46m 35s):
The investors made a great return.

3 (46m 37s):
Yeah. But in that year, a few months later, Andy at 39 years old was a university of Maryland basketball star was playing basketball on a Saturday with people like Ralph Samson. It was a great NBA star from the past and others in a New Jersey game. And he died of a brain aneurysm. And, and this was, you know, one of those moments where I realized I was the only person of the 38 of us who'd ever experienced sudden loss and trauma. And I brought in actually a great friend who was a grief counselor and we kind of worked this through together, but it, it, it ended up, I think, stealing those of us who were left to a survivor mentality that probably served us well.

Guy Raz (47m 33s):
All right. So you guys go public in the fall of 1999 and by the spring of 2000, the.com bubble burst it crashes. So I think, I think when a company goes public, the officers have to have to hold their stock. Right. Like they can't sell the stock immediately. So yeah. I mean, did, did anybody make money off of Audible going public?

3 (47m 57s):
Yeah. A bunch of venture capitalists certainly did because

Guy Raz (48m 1s):
Yeah, yeah. A

3 (48m 1s):
Couple of them. And here's the term in the day was like, you know, a w yeah, I would never have sold. I mean, I thought, you know, I thought it was, you know, I was told it was immoral for a founder to sell a share of stock. And I took that fairly seriously, but some of our VCs right after we went public began to, as the term was puke out their shares in very public filings and they were right. I mean, they, they made a lot of money off out of all. And because what happened next was not pretty, but, you know, I should say for context, I've heard that there were 1500 public internet companies at the beginning of 2,140 at the beginning of 2003.

3 (48m 48s):
So there were combinations there, there were some things that went on, but it was that kind of, you know, of decimation and the stock price, which was one $29 or something. It went down to 4 cents at the end of 2004 cents.

Guy Raz (49m 13s):
When we come back in just a moment, how Don was able to chart a new path for Audible, with help from one of the smartest and scariest people in Silicon valley, stay with us. I'm guy Raz. And you're listening to how I built this from NPR. Hey, welcome back to how I built this guy, Roz. So it's 2001. the.com bubble has burst Audible's stock price plummeted. And Don Katz is trying to stay calm.

3 (49m 51s):
I was incredibly anxious, but I just kind of had an attitude about it because we weren't out of capital yet. You know, and we had investors who had not given up Pope and it felt like there was just always another reason to keep fighting,

Guy Raz (50m 12s):
But still it's on. I mean, your stock was down, you guys weren't profitable yet. I mean, the market for what you were making, hadn't really taken off. So how are you strategizing? I mean, how are you going to guide the company through such a time?

3 (50m 28s):
Well, what happened during this period of time, as we did hunker down, and when you went public, you had to basically be trained to say one thing to all the fund investors, which was, we are technology agnostic. And what that was code for was that we will not build our, you say the word platform, because the word was in the nineties and life has changed a lot. Is that if the, if anyone said they were building a platform, Microsoft would make it their business to destroy your company. Right. And so, which, you know, if you look at some of the suits against myself, that there was some pretty good evidence, it was true.

3 (51m 8s):
Yeah. So we decided to not be technology agnostic. And during this period, when nobody was looking, we decided to take our pretty good science and, and call this the Audible ready platform, which would be the defacto way that spoken word was transmitted and played back in the new generation of MP3 players that were coming up. And we not only got all those deals done. We had Texas instrument chips that were already Audible ready. So when the dust started to clear a little bit in life, started to get a little bit better. We come out with all these MP3 players, which people were buying at the time with our bits inside the device and our marketing collateral inside the box.

3 (51m 57s):
So it kind of got hard to compete with us at that particular time, because we were of all these different companies that wanted to be doing the same kind of thing in a pretty good position. So that was one of those, you know, I always think, you know, you, you get to where we got by having about 51% of the things you're doing, being smart, seen it, named us the number one entertainment app on the web and, you know, things that made us feel pretty good. But as you also point out, the, the financial stuff got really dark and being a public company was not fun.

3 (52m 37s):
Yeah.

Guy Raz (52m 37s):
You mean, I mean, it would still take a couple of years before MP3 players would take off. And of course that happened with the iPod, which we'll get to in a moment, but how were you getting rights for audio books? Because audio books were still books on cassette and books on CD. So how are you getting the rights to get digital versions of that? Was it hard or was it pretty easy?

3 (53m 2s):
No, it was definitely hard. And it was, it was difficult to bridge a world that is very much not technology, no

Guy Raz (53m 12s):
Publishing, no

3 (53m 13s):
Book publishing as a is, is people who love books, meaning that they're willing to get paid less, or they have the wherewithal to not get paid a lot. And, you know, and they go into a world and usually they stand for the status quo and they usually resist, you know, technological change in particular and others. It's a, it's a longer story, but it's, it's been, it's been like this forever. So, so it was difficult, but eventually we did start to break through and be able to carry these audio books at a different cost. And then the other thing that we did figure it out was, was the subscription model.

Guy Raz (53m 53s):
Yeah. How did that, cause from what I understand, it was up until this point, it was, you buy a player, which you're asking a lot of people you're asking them to spend 200 bucks on an MP3 player and then 10, $5 on a book. That's a lot to ask people, right?

3 (54m 7s):
Yes. And that was the challenge. So what if you just got an audio book a month and a player and you get a year subscription. And that really helped. That helped a lot. Particularly since at that point, we had these Audible ready devices that other people, you know, but, but we started giving away a little blue MP3 player called the Otis. We got rid of the Audible mobile player and let that become the artifact it needed to be.

Guy Raz (54m 38s):
And the oldest was free if you got a subscription

3 (54m 42s):
And we just gave

Guy Raz (54m 43s):
Him more. And what was the, what was the commitment you have to do a year subscription or

3 (54m 47s):
It was a year, it was a year

Guy Raz (54m 48s):
Commitment. And what was the price?

3 (54m 50s):
It was actually 9 95 for two audio books. And we start

Guy Raz (54m 54s):
A month yeah.

3 (54m 55s):
A month. And it came to action. Yeah. And frankly, the, you know, the phone call I got around this period from Cupertino, California, from Steve jobs was a, was a Ray of hope. That was really meaningful.

Guy Raz (55m 11s):
Okay. So let's talk about this. Steve jobs calls you in 2001 and he said, Hey, I like this thing you're making,

3 (55m 18s):
He did. He said more than that. He said, tell me about this round, tripping, how you bookmark the content. I said a recent, I want to hear more about this. And then he asked all sorts of questions about the tech in very enthusiastically, which was kind of ironic because, you know, Steve was kind of known for, you know, not invented here, view on tech

Guy Raz (55m 38s):
Stealing stuff. Yeah.

3 (55m 40s):
So, so, but he was very, very focused on this. And, and he, he went on actually to talk in ways that we began to have fairly rich conversations because we shared this historic view of the interplay of technology and invention and culture, this whole idea that, you know, from chisels and caves to parchment, you have this amazing creative unleashing. He understood. I was surprised for what I thought would be a pure tech guy, the golden age of radio and how, you know, what that meant and how the music business exploded with creativity when it's shifted from sheet music. I mean, so we talked about this kind of stuff.

3 (56m 20s):
And he told me that he would weep copiously when he listened to Edmund white read Charlotte's web and he's, you know, he, so he just basically decided to tell me that he had this plan around this iPod and that I went home. And I remember telling my wife that Steve said, he's going to spend $15 million marketing their audio player. And I said, can you imagine if we had $15 million to market, you know, at Audible and this one thing led to another and the second generation iPod came out, it worked commercially with Audible.

Guy Raz (57m 3s):
So basically you would plug in, cause you used to have a plug in your iPod to your computer through that, you know, interface and, and you would go to the Audible website and that would download directly to the iPod.

3 (57m 15s):
Yep. And that, that was it. And so you would, it would, it would load up and, and they were these sweet little devices. They were very cool. The only thing we didn't get to do was put our marketing collateral in the, you know, in the, in the boxes.

Guy Raz (57m 29s):
So it didn't say Audible anywhere.

3 (57m 30s):
It did say that it was Audible ready. And that was that term that we'd kind of coined at the time. And that it started to mean something, at least in the world of people buying MP3 players. So we were able to garner our cost structure to be for the stakeholders who were going to get this. Yeah. You know, so we were able to target market to the people buying these new fangled, you know, players. And we were basically, you know, compatible with all of them. And once we started giving away minis, instead of, you know, our own player, it started to get better.

Guy Raz (58m 6s):
All right. So just to be clear, instead of giving away your own devices, as a way to get people to subscribe, you started to give away the apple iPod. And I think you did that for several years. I mean, I mean, Steve jobs kind of gave you a lifeline there. And so I'm assuming that pretty soon, you know, after that you just kind of stopped being a hardware company. Like, because eventually it would have been sort of pointless, right?

3 (58m 32s):
No, that's absolutely right. And you know, we were happy to get out of it and basically declare that, you know, hardware was a means to an end. There wouldn't be other transmission methodologies. We know we had partnerships with everybody, including the companies that were making CD burners at the time. And the like, so I always wanted it to be a means to an end.

Guy Raz (58m 51s):
You had a, I think by 2005. So you're now completely out of the hardware business. You're focused mainly on licensing audio and, and really you pivot towards audio books. When did that happen? What was the, what was the thinking around that?

3 (59m 7s):
I think it was just because it took off 2007, we still had 20,000 audio books. Now we have many, many hundreds of thousands, obviously in 20,000 audio books in 2007 and 45,000 other kinds of content, including Robbins' programs, <inAudible> programs, the amazing Susie bright erotica series, which has had, which was

Guy Raz (59m 30s):
Probably these were pre podcasts

3 (59m 33s):
Before the Turner light gas. Yeah. They were all short form programs. Yeah. They were just part of the repertoire.

Guy Raz (59m 39s):
I mean, you became the global supplier of audio books to iTunes already in 2003. So by that point it was clear that audio books was where you were headed towards what, what, what do you remember what the pivot point was? Where, where you were like, okay, we've broken through the publishing industry is, is, is cooperating.

3 (59m 59s):
Yeah. I think that the, the utility of the service, the idea of positioning this as a way to use your time now, it was also true that only about 15% of the books coming out were an audio. So our crusade was always to get more audio books made or to try to get the rights ourselves from the agent and the author to get the made, because we literally would run out of mysteries. And I would go at one point, I remember I would put my wallet on the desks of the CEOs and the publishing entities. I said, I need more content. So at that point, it wasn't coming.

3 (1h 0m 41s):
And we broke in to getting the rights ourselves and making a whole lot of audio books. We also figured out how to make an audio book for about a 10th of the cost that the just using technology, you know, so we just started making a lot of audio books and, and it got better and better. And there was something called project Hollywood and in 2011 and 2012, where we just said, let's just go find out what the greatest actors will do. And when I heard Kate Winslet due to Risa Rica, one of the darkest Zola novels of all the Zola novels, you know, and people heard what she could do.

3 (1h 1m 23s):
I remember thinking we could take this whole thing to a new level and make this about acting as much as it's about writing

Guy Raz (1h 1m 32s):
Don, I think by 2005. So this is like 10 years since you launched the business. You're you're 10 years in it's the first year you actually turn a profit. Yep. Just reflect that. I shouldn't reflect that for a moment because a lot of, well, I don't think enough people understand how long it can take, especially with a complex hardware slash content business. Like the one you created, how long it takes to actually make a profit. And, and even up until that point, I think 2005, you were still basically a small business. Right? I mean, you, you only ha you had fewer than a hundred employees, I think, right?

3 (1h 2m 9s):
Yeah. Since probably probably about

Guy Raz (1h 2m 11s):
Right. You took an 80% pay cut to start this business in 1995 until 2005. Did you ever get back to what you were paid in 1995

3 (1h 2m 23s):
And salary? Yeah, I definitely, I definitely did. If you're, if you look at the, you know, the, the vesting and the equity pieces and all that,

Guy Raz (1h 2m 33s):
But did you have to like cut family expenses and things like that for awhile?

3 (1h 2m 37s):
Yeah, there must've been some hairy moments, but the truth of the matter is I said, I never really measured my ideas and money. I just, I always thought, you know, the number of customers, the retention rate, the kinds of, of amazing content we could make, including, you know, tons of original thinking. I dunno, that stuff turned me on more and, you know, I still probably approach things that way.

Guy Raz (1h 3m 6s):
So it's interesting. Cause we did a story about lynda.com, which eventually sold to LinkedIn and their rise and your rise really mirror each other because you began around the same time. And I think, I think a lot of that has to do with broadband access.

3 (1h 3m 23s):
Yes. I mean, but obviously broadband access that, that download that system, they, they know the trust of, of, you know, of, of everything about from the e-commerce system to,

Guy Raz (1h 3m 33s):
To the system.

3 (1h 3m 34s):
And then we just started to have, you know, which I get it now we have this massive kind of brand momentum brand equity and that like, I mean, things, people started discovering this, this thing called Audible and we started to build up our teams. We started to expand internationally and kind of where, yeah, I admit it. I thought we'd be year three, which is why, you know, those survival years. But I got to tell you that the warrior spirit of those formative years, that is one of the reasons I still think we're so successful because the people that work at the company do try to see themselves as these kinds of people who want to invent and stay ahead as opposed to manage,

Guy Raz (1h 4m 21s):
You had this business plan, right. Which was audio delivered to people through the internet onto devices. But when you, when you think about that, right, do you almost wish that you would have, and, and there's no way to know, right. That businesses is most businesses just evolve. Like there really is no master plan. Like Jeff Bezos kind of had a plan, but it unfolded in ways that he probably couldn't really have anticipated all that maybe he did. But when you, when you, when you look back, do you often sort of kick yourself and say, God, I should have known from the beginning, this was going to be audio books and never have a wasted my time on the devices, on making the devices and just focused on the audio books.

3 (1h 5m 3s):
No, because then you're, you're not going to be the leader in, unless you take the big risk at the point that people don't believe. And you know, and then the question is how, how early is it? But I, you know, look, I am stunned, how quickly, you know, some of the companies formed after us did come together, but you know what most companies are based on productivity improvements. You it's like Uber gets you from here to here, like a taxi, but it just it's better. Most businesses have some level of productivity improvement, like all software businesses and the like that wasn't this idea. This was creating a media category.

3 (1h 5m 45s):
This was basically creating a spoken word category when it didn't exist in the country whose entire literary Canon was based on how we talked and told stories. I wanted to basically say there would be a spoken word category. Yeah. It called Audible. If it had to be, it sat next to all permutations of video and movies and TV, it sat next to books and it sat next to music and we kind of pride this thing into the light. And that's just a little different than a better way to use your computer.

Guy Raz (1h 6m 23s):
You know, we we've told the story of Shopify, which was founded and continues to exist in Ottawa and lynda.com was an OHI, California. And then in Ventura, California, these were not in, not near sand hill road in Silicon valley or in Seattle. And you were based in, in, in Wayne, New Jersey and then moved to Newark, which was not a place of a company as were going. I mean, it was still big parts of that city in 2007 were still boarded up. Parts of it are, are still boarded.

3 (1h 6m 56s):
I mean, you could just go all the way. Newark was thought to be a scary city. I mean, Newark was everything you heard about Newark was that this was a place that, you know, time had forgotten and that it was just crime ridden and had nothing good going for that was the word. And frankly, that's why I wanted to move us there when it came. But we were outgrowing this very ramshackle headquarters, which instantly was $12 a square foot with furniture and wiring talk about, you know, you know, cost-effective, we needed to go somewhere. And I said, let's move to downtown Newark.

3 (1h 7m 38s):
And besides we were becoming at that point, the largest employer of actors in the New York area, which one for awhile, and I said, the actors can jump on at Penn station. They can get off at broad street station, the board guys, and the consultants said, you're out of your mind, you're gonna, you're gonna lose. We think 30% of your workforce simply by moving that far and, and all the fear factor. And, you know, we moved in with 120 people and nobody left. And we started to just try to create either models that other companies or other cities could use to just be part of a city's comeback.

Guy Raz (1h 8m 22s):
So, so what kinds of things were you doing?

3 (1h 8m 25s):
So one of the first things we did was just said, you can't be a nepotistic intern anymore. Yeah. You gotta be a kid from Newark and you'll be a paid intern in our little world. So then you get like this carpet culture, which includes these incredible cutting edge technologists and all these English majors turned into business. People like me and then all the best, some of the best actors in the world hanging out and these kids and, and you start to realize that this is an unusually rich company culture. And, you know, we, we started paying our employees $500 after taxes, rent a frame. And if they moved downtown Newark and to be part of the urban pioneers, I started Newark venture partners, which has become a re an international level of, you know, success drawing companies from all over the world to Newark, to an accelerator.

3 (1h 9m 19s):
It's anyways, it's just applying the kind of entrepreneurial thinking that gets to create an Audible to, to, you know, to, to social purpose.

Guy Raz (1h 9m 30s):
In 2007, your annual revenue at Audible was like $110 million. And in January of 2008, Amazon announced that they would acquire Audible for $300 million in cash, which in, in retrospect, they got a great deal for you. Look back on it, especially given that your revenue is 110 million the year before, obviously you didn't control the company, you were a shareholder, but at the time, did you think it was the right move for Audible?

3 (1h 10m 3s):
At the time, I was the only one who thought it was a right move. So this was me. And it was a blast to be a NASDAQ CEO, even all the trials and tribulations. There were things about it that I, I love because it was just another adventure into a new world. But by the time 2007, 2008 came along, I was really in a moral crossroads because, you know, if you read everything from the law to Milton Friedman, the only purpose of, of a CEO and a chair and CEO as I was, is to enrich their shareholders. I

Guy Raz (1h 10m 43s):
Mean, maximize shareholder profit,

3 (1h 10m 44s):
That's what it is. And so I was basically working for people that I stopped feeling like I was honestly waking up in the morning. I was in caring about them. And it was very hard to, because a lot of them were fricking computer programs that were whipping our stock around after hours in various complex high velocity models. And others were 100% speculators who could have cared less about being real investors. And I just wasn't into it. And on top of that, I knew that if I could hook back in with Jeff and with Amazon, we could have access to several hundred million people with credit cards who were likely to be our customers.

3 (1h 11m 35s):
We would go even faster and we'd have that many more millions of people, the freedom to even do the things doing in Newark that was meaningful to me. And it's a, it's a, you know, it's somewhat rare, a lot of founders don't, you know, they go away as soon as a transaction happens, but yeah, but in this case, it's an independent subsidiary that works.

Guy Raz (1h 11m 56s):
You know, it's interesting. A lot of Amazon has a lot of haters, right? Cause it's 800 pound gorilla on the block and it's just going to happen. It's going to be that way. But if you look at Amazon compared to other giants that acquire the companies, they, they really do. They have a great track record of allowing their, their acquisition companies to remain independent. I mean, look at Zappos. We had Tony, the late Tony Shay was a guest on our show, an amazing entrepreneur. I mean, that company was, and is totally dependent. AAudible is an Amazon company, but it, it, I mean, it's, you stayed on, I think I was thinking about this.

Guy Raz (1h 12m 36s):
You stayed on as CEO of Audible after Amazon acquired you for as long as you were the head of the company when it was independent, when, when it was, so that alone suggests that it was a pretty good marriage.

3 (1h 12m 55s):
Yeah. It's a pretty unusual story. And I frankly can't believe that it's now longer than my, than my writing career. And also, you know, come on, let's face it. Most people know that, you know, senior people at Amazon get paid in Amazon stuff. So we did the transaction. The stock was like $50 a share. You might want to check out what it is now. So one way or another, whatever happens from here, it's been an amazing adventure and not many people I know who had two careers where you get to turn ideas into reality. It's, it's, I've been pretty, pretty lucky.

Guy Raz (1h 13m 34s):
A lot of things happened to a lot of people that are lucky. I know you've mentioned meeting your wife, for example, is a lucky moment. And I would say the same about mine have, or, or the fact that Yon winners had go to go to Spain and cover this thing. And you met all these, like these guys who covered the, the, you know, the Spanish, civil war and were like, Hey, yeah, we'll show you the ropes here. You know, somebody who, who, who gave you lucky break or this guy mot, who thought your idea was, was great when everyone else thought it was cookie. So there were a lot of lucky moments, but you also grinded and grind it and worked really hard.

3 (1h 14m 11s):
But when you think this story that you've told me and you reflect on it, how much of it do you think has to do with luck and how much do you think has to do with the work you put in? I think it's something on the order of 55.5 to 51% purposeful, good calls and, and brave moments. And, and times when you just didn't give up the rest of it is definitely luck because otherwise, how could, I've made so many stupid boneheaded decisions along the way that didn't didn't kill us. So I think there's a fine line. You're making calls all the time.

3 (1h 14m 52s):
And particularly if you're a leader, you kind of got to do it. But I, I don't know. I think about it, you know, about it all the time, but I feel I, I was out there playing ice hockey last night and you know, not many people my age get to play ice hockey is that luck. I think it's luck. And I think it's also that I just made it my business to try to elongate my hockey career. And I do a lot of stuff to make that real That's Don Katz, founder, and executive chairman of Audible. By the way, a few years back, the company put together a list of some of its most popular audio books. Over the past 20 years, the best-selling memoir was bossy pants by Tina Fey, the best-selling business book, the seven habits of highly effective people.

3 (1h 15m 40s):
The most repeated listen was Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's stone, which makes a lot of sense. And here's one that all of you can probably guess in advance. The most searched for author on Audible over the past 20 years was of course, Stephen King. Hey, thanks so much for listening to the show this week.
