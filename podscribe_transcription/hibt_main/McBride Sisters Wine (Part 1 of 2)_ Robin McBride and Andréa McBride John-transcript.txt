Hey everyone. So I have a request if you value this show if you value the stories the lessons the wisdom and inspiration we bring to you if you think of me as your friend, which I am because even though millions of you are listening. I'm actually talking just to you right now. I need you to be there for me as well. And you can do that by supporting what I do and buying my book how I built this it is just out now and available everywhere and it It doesn't cost more than a few cups of coffee. And it's filled with wisdom and stories and ideas that will have you feeling inspired and fired up to Take On The World.

2 (41s):
So please if you love the show

4 (43s):
and what we do for you do us one back and pick up how I built this wherever books are sold.

2 (53s):
Sometimes they would just drive with no light distillation in mind and we would just be talking and we would kind of what we call now

3 (1m 2s):
just drive and dream and we would just talk about like hey, yo, what would it be? Like like if we started

2 (1m 9s):
our own wine

4 (1m 9s):
company, that's so crazy.

2 (1m 13s):
How could we possibly do that? We don't know how to make wine. We have no money. That's crazy. But but how crazy is it that? Though and then finally got to the point where we were

4 (1m 23s):
like. Well, what's stopping us?

3 (1m 32s):
Ramen PR is how I built this show about innovators entrepreneurs idealists and the stories behind the movements. They built I'm Gyros and on the show today how two sisters who grew up on opposite sides of the world discovered each other met for the first time and then launched an idea that would grow into one of the biggest black owned wine companies

4 (1m 56s):
in the

2 (1m 57s):
World McBride

4 (1m 58s):
sisters It's possible. You've never heard of McBride Sisters wine and that you've never had one of their chardonnays or brute roses or one of their Blended Reds and it's even possible. You don't drink wine at all. But I'm here to tell you none of this matters for the purposes of today's episode

3 (2m 21s):
because

4 (2m 22s):
even if all of the above applies to you this story will change some of the things you might think about business about faith.

1 (2m 31s):
Destiny about overcoming

4 (2m 33s):
incredible obstacles and mostly about love this story is so epic that we decided it needed two episodes. So this week you'll hear part 1 of how sisters andreea and Robin McBride built the McBride Sisters wine company and next week. You'll hear part 2, I'll start with the basics McBride Sisters wine is now one of the largest black-owned wine

3 (2m 59s):
businesses in the

4 (2m 60s):
world. There are roughly 11,000 winemakers in the US and McBride Sisters wine is among the top two percent in terms of how much Y and they produce per year.

3 (3m 11s):
You can find their wines at most

4 (3m 13s):
major stores like Target and Walmart, and they're also higher-end. So about 20 bucks a bottle but still designed to be accessible, especially the people who might be intimidated by wine culture and this is the

3 (3m 27s):
precise problem andreea and Robin set out to

4 (3m 30s):
solve. Peta open up the sometimes intimidating world of wine appreciation to people normally shutout young people people of color women, but also make the wine good enough to attract wine snobs Robin and Andrea actually founded their business in 2005 and they faced just about every barrier imaginable. They were young women of color with no immediate access to a winery no money. No connections, but what they shared was a passion a deep abiding passion for

3 (4m 7s):
wine and something else. They

4 (4m 8s):
shared a bond that was forged the unification the two sisters were born nine years apart both have different mothers, but share the same

3 (4m 18s):
father and for most of their early

4 (4m 21s):
lives neither sister knew the other even existed but remarkably both women grew up in wine

3 (4m 28s):
producing regions, andreea, the younger

4 (4m 31s):
Stir grew up near sauvignon blanc Vineyards in New Zealand. Well almost 7,000 miles away. Her older sister Robyn was living in Monterey, California with her

1 (4m 42s):
mom my mom and

3 (4m 45s):
our shared father divorced when I was a baby. I'm

1 (4m 48s):
so it was only she

2 (4m 50s):
and I so she never

1 (4m 51s):
remarried and she didn't have any more children. She really honestly didn't even date very much that I was

2 (4m 58s):
aware of. Anyway, maybe she hid

1 (4m 59s):
it from me. I'm not sure. And she didn't have a large family at all. She was an only child also, so it was really just her and I together in the world, you know, we were really had a really strong bond and really quite ended on each

4 (5m 14s):
other and when you were growing up you didn't have much contact with your dad

2 (5m 18s):
right none at all, you know, a little context. My mom

1 (5m 21s):
wasn't thrilled with our father when they divorced and you know, it was no accidents that they weren't in communication. It was something that she isn't interested. You know in doing so for me from a really young age. I was just always, you know, as a child who has a missing parents. I was just always like you know, where is he? What's going on? Why don't why isn't my dad on my life? You know, I had a lot of questions for my mom and she was like, well, you know, she always told me like well, you know, he's probably in La somewhere and she's like, I don't want to have any communication with him. She's like grow. Go up and do your thing, right when you're 18, you know, if you feel like you want to start a search to find him go ahead and do that.

1 (6m 9s):
And so I'd always planned. It was always something that I wanted to do because I did want to figure out who this mysterious person was and you know, hopefully have a chance to meet him.

4 (6m 20s):
What kind of things were you interested in as a little

1 (6m 23s):
girl. I was a really weird sort of child and I think part of that has to do with the fact that you know, I didn't have

2 (6m 31s):
Like cousins around and we didn't have a

1 (6m 33s):
larger family dynamics that was really kind of, you know a loner a little bit but that had me out exploring the world a lot kind of on my own so, you know just really curious about nature and the environment and kind of more of that than you know, people and socializing, you know, and that aspects of the world so, you know

2 (6m 58s):
kind of a little a little bit of

4 (6m 59s):
a different child. Tomorrow a feel when you're growing up. I mean, obviously there's you know in Salinas and Monterey and some of the surrounding areas. There's a strong Latino population when you were a kid did it feel diverse or did it feel pretty homogeneous?

1 (7m 14s):
Yeah. No, it absolutely was not diverse. And as a matter of fact when I was in elementary school, I think I was the only non-white child in the school for a number of years. So quite homogeneous. I would say

4 (7m 28s):
did you were you aware of that? Early on like we're you did you feel

1 (7m 33s):
different absolutely and you know kids are kids right? So they made sure that I do I was aware of that and pointed out how I was different and because I wasn't growing up with our father who is black and I'm biracial my mother's of German Heritage. I was you know, literally the only one that was quite confusing. I very much felt like an outsider I think in the community and what isn't quite sure how to process it as a

2 (8m 3s):
little girl,

1 (8m 4s):
but very aware that I was different than

4 (8m 6s):
literally everybody else around me when you when you finished high school. What did you decide to do? I did you did you want to go to college? Did you want to just go right into the

3 (8m 16s):
workforce? Yeah. So

1 (8m 18s):
actually I mean Academia was always a challenge for me just in terms of the structure and the method of learning and by you know, a couple of years into high school. I was just like this is this

2 (8m 30s):
is not

3 (8m 31s):
Me and I was a

2 (8m 32s):
really bright

1 (8m 34s):
child and I kind of felt like, you know, I can learn anything that I want without all of this rigmarole and I actually left high school early. I test it out early with there's a special test if you're too young to take a GED, so I wanted to go to school and I went to the local Community College. I wasn't exactly sure what I wanted to do, but I really did love science. So I started taking some courses there. And then while I was you know, this was 16 at that point.

2 (9m 1s):
Wow. And so while I was there like the following

1 (9m 2s):
year I started working at a little company that manufactured some electronics that were used in this scientific industry and Industrial Products. And I really became fascinated being in that environment just really sparked everything in my brain and I was just so excited by it. And I know I ended up staying at that company for for 10 years. I just kind of grew through the ranks there.

3 (9m 25s):
Wow, something you join this when you were almost 16 or 17, and I was 17. I lied. I told them I I told them I was 18.

4 (9m 34s):
All right, we're gonna hit pause and come to Andrea. And then we're going to come back to both of you. So nine years later

3 (9m 43s):
Andrea, you were born

4 (9m 45s):
also in the United States, right?

2 (9m 47s):
Yes, correct in Los Angeles. So for me, I'll father and my mother they were married until I was about four or five and divorced in around the same time. My mother was Is diagnosed with breast

4 (10m 3s):
cancer so she decided to leave the US and your mom based on your accent.

3 (10m 9s):
I'm assuming she was not she's not Americanized risk

4 (10m 13s):
from New Zealand New Zealand. Okay, so around that time when she was diagnosed she decided to move back to New

2 (10m 20s):
Zealand. Yeah, she was told that you know that she was terminal and then she decided the best thing for her and I was that we go back to New Zealand where She was originally from where her parents my grandparents were and her brother my uncle. So

4 (10m 39s):
how old were you when you moved to New

2 (10m 41s):
Zealand I was six and a half hours in only seven when I went to New Zealand. I went by

3 (10m 45s):
myself.

2 (10m 46s):
My mom had a business in Los Angeles. She had a lot of things that she wanted to tie up and organized and I think that her cancer Advanced much quicker. Quicker than they had anticipated and so she put me on a plane down to New

3 (11m 6s):
Zealand as a six and a half year old

2 (11m 9s):
and I remember at the time being, you know on the plane by myself and you know back in the 80s. There was still a

3 (11m 19s):
smoking section

2 (11m 21s):
and I was really intrigued as to I remember being intrigued as to like why there were these curtains

4 (11m 27s):
that

2 (11m 27s):
separated when part of the plan C of a but it was

4 (11m 31s):
also quite exciting sort of bait is elf and remember

2 (11m 35s):
going down and my my grandparents and my uncle retrieving me from the airport and I just remember immediately it

3 (11m 45s):
looking so different than Los Angeles and I think

4 (11m 50s):
what struck me was that they weren't really that many people

2 (11m 55s):
and it wasn't freeways and there wasn't a lot of cars and where we were at the top of the south island and blame them was very green and there was a lot of farmland and it was just very

4 (12m 10s):
quiet and from what I understand your mom passed away pretty soon after you were

2 (12m 15s):
there. Yeah. She it was about we were there about two and a half months and then she passed away.

4 (12m 23s):
So after your mom your mom's passing, where did you live?

2 (12m 28s):
yeah, so my mum also, I think had bigger bigger family than Robins man, but quite small and that she had just one brother and my grandparents were in the 80s when I was seven and so I initially split time between my grandparents and my uncle and then shortly thereafter my grandfather passed away and then my grandmother passed away and and then I think my uncle felt like it was important that I grew up with other kids and that I have a mother and so at the time he decided that it would be a good idea that I split my time between a foster family and with him,

4 (13m 21s):
I think anybody hearing your story would be hard-pressed to figure out how you Or able to just kind of get to your childhood, right? I mean, I think a lot of us just kind of forget children are super resilient. Like they're just there's this kind of thing that they have this kind of

3 (13m 45s):
mysterious

4 (13m 46s):
power to just kind of carry on. How would you describe your childhood? I mean so many challenging difficult things happen to you at an early age, but do you feel in general that despite those things? You had a kind of a normal childhood?

3 (14m 1s):
I wouldn't say normal.

2 (14m 5s):
I would say that given the situation of being a

1 (14m 10s):
ward of the state and in a foster care

2 (14m 13s):
situation that I

3 (14m 15s):
was very lucky

2 (14m 17s):
that the family that I was placed with my mom who I called. My mom today is just an exceptional woman and wasn't in the practice of having foster

4 (14m 30s):
children. To collect checks or whatever sort of, you know, some of the

2 (14m 33s):
horror stories that you hear. She legitimately wanted to have another child and I'm very lucky in the sense that that situation could have been much worse. Yeah,

3 (14m 42s):
and I think in light of that it

1 (14m 44s):
was a very very good situation. I think I think

2 (14m 48s):
there's definitely challenges in when you're a kid trying to figure out why you're in a foster a foster child or foster care situation when you have family and why you're just not with that family. Yeah, so that's really difficult. And I think to your point children are really resilient.

4 (15m 7s):
Do you remember as a kid feeling I'm gonna ask us Robin a version of this question, but I mean obviously news New Zealand is is primarily, you know, people that are primarily of white European origin or Maori origin. Did you did you have a sense of your own identity? Did you did you feel

3 (15m 29s):
different? Yes, I

2 (15m 32s):
think I definitely stood out and you touched on it the indigenous people to New Zealand. I'm already we also today have a lot of people from the Pacific Islands but in the 80s, especially in the South Island, there were not a lot of Maori people and they were definitely not a lot of Pacific island people and you know, the slave trade didn't go through Zealand's so you don't have people of African descent. I was very dark compared to what people were used to seeing, you know, I was obviously very different than when you look at I guess physically what Maori people look like.

2 (16m 13s):
I'm six foot one now. So I was you know, I was this very tall lanky darker to them child. And as Robin noted before, you know kids made sure that the I knew that I was different and even adults to you know, it was Something I was very very aware of and other people definitely highlighted

4 (16m 37s):
that I guess as a as a teenager. You were pretty good athlete. I mean really good athlete. Did you ran track and field and played volleyball? And and did you kind of throw yourself into that? Was that kind of your main focus as a teenager?

2 (16m 50s):
Yeah. That was that was I guess for me that was like what am I because I reflecting now didn't probably realize it in the moment, but was quite angry and I think Sport was my coping mechanism, you know and where I could get out that frustration and anger and it was my vehicle to deal with a lot of the things that that I was going through at the time

4 (17m 19s):
Andrew. Did you know you had any other blood relatives out in the

2 (17m 24s):
world? No, I as well. I thought I was an only child until I was was a libin

4 (17m 33s):
robin. Did you did you know that you had any other relatives out in the world? I did

1 (17m 39s):
not although I knew it wasn't out of the realm of possibilities given that we hadn't been in touch with my father for so many years, but you just didn't go I just didn't know. I mean, I know

4 (17m 51s):
you had a sister

1 (17m 52s):
right did either of you when

4 (17m 54s):
you were when you were girls or teenagers start to get curious about Finding or looking for potential relatives or not quite

2 (18m 5s):
yet. No, I mean for me, I think my experience was you know, I had gone down to New Zealand. I stopped communicating with my dad. I think maybe in my mind I thought maybe maybe he had died as well. You know that was sort of like the reason that we had stopped communicating and I was young so I think you know, I just I just don't think I would have processed. Or been thinking about like maybe there could be other siblings. I think I was. I hadn't gone down those rabbit holes

4 (18m 39s):
yet. So neither of you really knew a whole lot about your dad because I guess Robin you were just a baby when your parents split and Andre you weren't much older, but suddenly, I guess like in 1995 he resurfaced right and and Andre he be he reached out to you in New Zealand, right? Correct? And how did you hear from him?

2 (19m 5s):
I was with my foster family. May I My brother Ben were my

1 (19m 13s):
foster brother. We were

2 (19m 15s):
watching TV cartoons, you know after school

3 (19m 19s):
and the phone rang and I

2 (19m 20s):
was kind of like the closest one to the phone. So I picked up the phone and at the time I really couldn't understand what the person was saying and I thought it was like one of our friends kind of like playing a trick on us. Remember the

3 (19m 35s):
like the voice was like

2 (19m 36s):
super deep and Basie and and then I just just heard the words Andre, it's your dad your

3 (19m 44s):
daddy. And you know

2 (19m 48s):
pretty emotional

3 (19m 51s):
time to say the least and

2 (19m 56s):
you know, and that conversation. He was just sort of telling me where he'd been and that you know that he was so happy to have found me and that I hit this big sister and her name was Robin McBride. And the unfortunately as well but he had been diagnosed with cancer, but he was going to beat it.

3 (20m 24s):
He said all that in one phone call.

4 (20m 29s):
Wow. So you knew that you had a sister but didn't know how to find her.

3 (20m 36s):
Correct. Yeah,

1 (20m 38s):
it was it was really surreal because when our

2 (20m 42s):
dad first reached out, you know. I think helping I'm optimistic and wanting to beat cancer, you know, that was just his personality and for me, I remember thinking like, oh, here we go again, and I remember with going through with my mother having cancer and me being so young going to the hospital her getting chemo. All these things were just normal, you know, there was no

3 (21m 13s):
context into it and two out. So she passed away. So I was like, oh, here we go again.

2 (21m 18s):
And then I think because he wanted to be so positive and optimistic it got to a point where I was like,

3 (21m 26s):
okay. Well, yeah, maybe he is going to beat

2 (21m 27s):
this and you know, he got back in contact with me and you know during this period of time where you know writing

3 (21m 38s):
letters we're talking on the phone. We're building our relationship up and

2 (21m 42s):
then I remember my

3 (21m 44s):
foster.

2 (21m 45s):
Mom calling me and saying hey Andrea, your dad didn't want to tell you but he's actually really really sick and you need to go

3 (21m 54s):
to America right now. Sorry and he passed

1 (21m 60s):
away. before she arrived Sorry.

3 (22m 6s):
so it thinks that I had felt like I had lost it everybody that I really love the

4 (22m 14s):
most. I mean at the same time Robin you were living in Monterey and you were totally unaware of your dad's conditional or where he was or or even the fact that Andre existed. How did you find out about your sister?

2 (22m 37s):
So, you know from that

1 (22m 39s):
point when our dad was able to make Contacts with Andrea his family stepped in to help with the efforts to try to find me. And you know between the point of our dad making contact with Andre and between the time that they found me was, you know, three or four years, I guess that it took and I had actually moved from California from Monterey to Atlanta and I was working in Atlanta and evidently. Our father's family had started to look up through public records and whatever means are necessary. Very I hear that there was an episode of Oprah that helps them with some tips to you know, how you locate somebody who you're not in contact with and they started sending letters out to people that they could find with my name.

1 (23m 32s):
They knew my name the family had my birth announcement so they had my full

4 (23m 36s):
name, but still Robin McBride. I mean there must have been hundreds of Robin McBride's in

1 (23m 42s):
America. Yeah. I'm not sure how many how many they actually send letters to but eventually only one arrived at my mom's address back in Monterey.

4 (23m 53s):
And what did that what did that letter say?

3 (23m 55s):
Yeah, she called me because she was a

1 (23m 57s):
little she was a little off guard because a letter arrived from last name McBride and Alabama, which is why our dad was originally from and she fully was not expecting a letter from him or his family. So she said I've got this letter and it's addressed to you to want me to open it. So I was like, yeah, absolutely and in the letter it was written by our And our dad sister who lives in Camden Alabama, which is a little tiny place outside of Selma and she introduced herself in the letter and said we're reaching out to you and you know want to let you know that your father has passed away at this point.

1 (24m 37s):
He had passed away in 1996 the letter I got January of 1999 and said that your father has passed away and we went desperately. To find you you have a little sister Andrea and you know at the time she was 16 years old, and she she lives in New Zealand and you know, we're just really trying to find you on connect the two of

4 (25m 3s):
you. I'm sorry.

1 (25m 7s):
I have little kids I get really

3 (25m 11s):
super emotional when I can feed my kids. Um, yeah, I mean was that just totally

4 (25m 16s):
shocking to you

1 (25m 18s):
it was absolutely shocking because you know, I had not yet started my own search to find our father and you know as a little girl who's missing a father in her life. I think you know there was Always a hope and a dream, you know somewhere that I would one day be able to meet my dad and kind of fill that that Gap, you know, that's created by having, you know a parent who's not there. So just reading that first line that he had already passed away, you know sort of all at once it kind of has very emotional and you know, I had to deal with the fact that I was never going to know that person he was never going to see me, you know as a grown Ian and that was really difficult to deal with sort of all at once but you know here was this other bit of information that I have a sister and so although the letters, you know stated that she was in New Zealand and so I was like, I wasn't even sure where New Zealand was exactly on the map.

1 (26m 23s):
So yeah, I was a little concerned that it might be difficult to meet the sister. But

2 (26m 30s):
you know with that information there was

1 (26m 32s):
a phone number on the letter so

3 (26m 35s):
I was like, well, I need to

1 (26m 37s):
just just suck it up and suck up all the emotions and sort of the disappointment and the reality of the situation with my father, but I need to call our family and you know learn about the sister that I just found out about and how we can potentially meet.

3 (26m 57s):
When we come back in just a moment what it was like when they eventually did meet stay with us. I'm guy Roz and you're listening to how I built this from NPR.

4 (29m 56s):
Welcome back to how I built this from NPR. I'm guy Roz. So it's the late 1990s. And Robin McBride has just received a letter that says her father has died and that she has a 16 year-old half-sister named Andrea who's been living on the opposite side of the world in New Zealand and the two of them have never met

2 (30m 20s):
so in that

4 (30m 21s):
moment robyn's life basically turns

3 (30m 25s):
Side down but very soon after receiving the letter

4 (30m 29s):
she picks up the phone and reaches out for the first time to her father's family

1 (30m 34s):
are on answer the phone and bless her heart. She was very excited that after all of their efforts for so many years that I was calling her and I think I don't really get much information.

2 (30m 49s):
What I got was a lot of

1 (30m 51s):
shouting and screaming

3 (30m 53s):
and celebration. Ian and I didn't really quite

1 (30m 56s):
understand why it first but that was because Andrea was

3 (31m 1s):
in Alabama. She

1 (31m 3s):
was with her father's family visiting them for the first time. She came to visit for the holidays. She was there when you

4 (31m 10s):
received that letter in

3 (31m 11s):
Atlanta she was so and again, yeah, so I was in

1 (31m 14s):
Atlanta and and Camden Alabama's probably a half hour drive from from where I was sitting at that moment. So I'm very unlikely that the timing was what it was. But our aunt was, you know, very excited that it happened when it did and she actually said a hold on talk to your sister and I was very confused because my sister lives in New Zealand, I thought according to the letter but of course on Jo was sitting in her house. So within a moment's notice, I was I was on the phone with this this new sister that I didn't know. I had a few minutes ago.

4 (31m 51s):
I'm Dre. Do you remember what I mean? That must have been such a strange and even awkward

1 (31m 56s):
conversation. It was it was really surreal because I

2 (32m 1s):
think for me even though I had known about Robin for four years, I think. In the context of how I learned about her and our dad passing away. I had pushed it off into this place in my brain where I was just

4 (32m 23s):
kill it wasn't a reality

2 (32m 25s):
Robin. What do you

4 (32m 27s):
remember about the phone conversation between the two of you?

1 (32m 31s):
I think I remember that I wasn't prepared for it. Hmm on top of that. She had a very strong New Zealand accent. So on the phone. Is passed over to her and I think it's like, excuse me. Who is this friend, you know, she was like a son Draya and you know it just it took a moment to really try to figure out how we could possibly be on the phone, but we did have a brief conversation and we made plans to meet a person she was going to New York the next day and I was going to be the next day.

4 (33m 4s):
Yep. She was going back to New York to go back to New Zealand. She

1 (33m 7s):
was going to New York to meet some more. VAR dad's family a couple of our uncles and cousins that lived to New York. A lot of our dad's family sort of migrated from the south up to New York. And so she had already had plans to go and meet them. And so I said, well, I I'll meet you there the next day.

4 (33m 24s):
Wow, and we're in New York where you going to

1 (33m 26s):
meet we made plans to meet in the most beautiful place we could think of which was the Guardia

3 (33m 32s):
airport.

4 (33m 35s):
So next day you fly to LaGuardia both of you and what Remember about seeing your sister for the first time. Did you did you like go to her Gates? Did

1 (33m 44s):
you why don't I honestly have no memory of between the time that she and I spoke to the time I was on an airplane to go meet her. So whatever happens there. I don't know but I do know that I suddenly started to become very anxious about the situation in route. Not that I was, you know afraid of her, but I just, you know, I knew I was going to become a different person when We met yeah,

3 (34m 11s):
I'm your life was gonna change ya know the journey just seemed excruciating Lee

1 (34m 16s):
long and when we met this is pre nine, eleven, so andreea and our uncles and cousins were at the gate at the airport awaiting my arrival.

4 (34m 27s):
So you walked off the plane and they were waiting for you at the gate.

1 (34m 30s):
Yes. They were all there a large group of people with their who I didn't

3 (34m 34s):
know never met and

1 (34m 36s):
never seen pictures of and that's one of the things that it's you know, Didn't have I don't know who I was looking for. And you know, I'm biracial. I wasn't quite sure if she also was biracial, you know, I just didn't know I didn't know who to look for. Yeah, and I had to have as I was, you know deboarding the play and I had to really like go through some sort of mental exercises to calm myself down because I was kind of yeah, that's

3 (35m 3s):
kind of freaked out a little bit. I'm freaking out right now you're freaking out for me. So You know, I

2 (35m 10s):
was I was talking to myself. I was

4 (35m 12s):
trying to you know, use every like sort of

1 (35m 15s):
mantras I could think of to just Center myself and as I was doing so and walking off of the plane and I looked forward down the jetway and I saw myself in the reflection at the end of a the jetway in a mirror and telling myself you can do this, you know, don't you know kind of shadow of being xiety and you're here now this is going to happen and I realize that my reflection that was looking back at me wasn't walking as I was walking.

4 (35m 47s):
It wasn't you?

1 (35m 48s):
It wasn't me. It was my sister that was waiting for me at the gate and I realized that we

3 (35m 56s):
actually do look exactly like actually yeah,

1 (36m 1s):
and you know, I was able to recognize her and identify her and I just remember I say this little girl, but she was very tall already at that point. And this young girl, you know, and her eyes were just completely wide open and I could tell that she was also thinking the same thing I was which is you know, oh my gosh, am I saying my sister for the first time and yeah, that was the first time that we laid eyes on each

2 (36m 28s):
other. I

4 (36m 30s):
I think that I think that the real world is more complex than a film right because in the movie you would say. Oh instantly we were we fell in love we were bonded, but I wonder under eye when you saw your sister. Was it was there? Did you feel like almost an instant bond? Did you feel like Oh my God, this is me. I'm looking at me

2 (36m 54s):
I did and and even hearing Robin talking about that. I'm the baby sister. I'm clearly like the

3 (37m 1s):
emotional and you know,

2 (37m 6s):
you know even to this day still hearing that it makes me super

1 (37m 9s):
emotional

2 (37m 11s):
just because my sister is so precious to me. Hmm But to answer your question. Yes. You know, I just remember

4 (37m 22s):
like Robin said I felt like I was a deer in

2 (37m 24s):
headlights and I just like immediately locked in on her and you know, we just locked in on each other and

1 (37m 35s):
crazy thing is we didn't say

2 (37m 36s):
anything. We just kind of like

4 (37m 39s):
magnets just

2 (37m 41s):
hugged. Yeah and anchor and cried and I think at one point It may be, you know, three or four minutes and I think I might have said you're robbing

3 (37m 54s):
right

2 (38m 0s):
for us. You know, there was an immediate bond

4 (38m 4s):
in. I mean you had so much catching up to do you'd 16 years and rub you 25 years of catching up to do did did Andre did you know at that point? I mean you were still you're eventually gonna go back to New Zealand, but did you in your mind kind of know that? You had to figure out how to be near your sister at that point

2 (38m 22s):
immediately. It was so life-changing for me. Yeah, you touched on this before Sports initially early for me was kind of my vehicle of kind of dealing with a challenging upbringing and it would be the vehicle that got me back to the United States and got my clothes Robin

4 (38m 44s):
you decided that you would figure out how to get back to the us as an athlete as

3 (38m 49s):
Analytics College. Yes, and you did you ended up at USC? That's it.

4 (38m 53s):
Yes, and you went to USC because Robin at the time you were living where we living I had

1 (38m 59s):
moved back after we met I moves back to Monterey California anticipating that she was going to choose one of the California universities to go

4 (39m 12s):
to so you go to USC and really but the really real the real reason was to be Geographically closer to your sister. So you guys could be together. So clearly the both of you knew that you were going to your the rest of your lives are going to be in the same geographical

1 (39m 29s):
area. Correct? Yeah. Oh, yeah. I know I was there to pick her up at the airport

3 (39m 33s):
her giant Javelin you you brought a javelin with you.

4 (39m 37s):
Did she traveled? Well, she traveled from New

3 (39m 40s):
Zealand with a javelin. I was a javelin thrower I got to bring my job comes with me

4 (39m 48s):
so you I mean you had some back and forth and you're probably spending like holidays in Monterey or vice

1 (39m 54s):
versa. Yeah, we travels I mean back and forth as often as we could. It's you know, we're in the same stage. It's not super close between water and Allah is probably five or six hour drive, but we took every opportunity we could just spend time together and Andrea, you know is great because Andre I got to come up to Monterey and see where I grew up. Yeah, eventually I got to go to visit New Zealand we Found out that they're remarkably

3 (40m 20s):
similar. It's that's crazy. Realize are pretty much the

1 (40m 23s):
exact same places just in different size of the hemisphere. But and then you know, we would sometimes meet in the middle, which is not a whole lot between monitoring Allah accept their Wine Country and agriculture kind of meeting in the country and right meeting a different, you know, wineries or places off the side of the road. So that's what we did for the next few years

4 (40m 46s):
the both of you just had I mean, obviously New Zealand which is a huge one making part of the world and you come from Monterey which is a huge wine making part of the world and so I'm not surprised both of you were into wine, but both of you were into

2 (40m 58s):
wine we were yeah, but it was different though because I think you know for me my entry point to Wine was my grandparents were always involved in agriculture and they were farmers and then in the 1980s specifically in Blenheim. The region is known as Marlborough. You start to go through this transition of thinking about seriously becoming a white a commercial wine growing region. And so there was a lot of people that might have been farming Tomatoes peas potatoes that looked at the opportunity of planting Vineyards from scratch.

2 (41m 38s):
Yeah planting the scrape called 70 en Blanc and then collectively selling it to the largest Brewery and the country at the time also was the winemaker. Selling it as grape Growers to this Brewery and it's crazy because you know at that time you have fly into this region and they're just being oldest all these fields in are everywhere and now you find some over and it's just vignette. There's no

3 (42m 4s):
more plot in. Yeah, there's no more no more

2 (42m 7s):
plantable area. And so, you know splitting time between my uncle and my new family when I was with him, you know when you're in An agriculture family in your kid, you are free

3 (42m 21s):
labor. Yeah, you know you're picking great.

2 (42m 25s):
Well, even even before the grapes are ready to harvest like, you know, we were running posts in the ground and running wires and bench crafting plants and planting them in the ground. And so my introduction to to Wine was from the growing perspective. Wow, and definitely was convinced. I was never going to be in Wine industry because it's so hard. Yeah. Simon is very hard work. And then for me it connected the dots of how you know, all this love and this care and this dedication and hard work and community of people that it takes to take care of grapevines for the purpose of making wine how that translated into this beautiful glass of wine.

2 (43m 15s):
And Robin

4 (43m 15s):
were to you do remember having conversations. Nations about why like because because your sister was young like

3 (43m 21s):
it's pretty rare for any

4 (43m 22s):
college student to be into wine, like often times or until like jello

3 (43m 26s):
shots thinking. Yeah, and she we would have these

1 (43m 30s):
conversations and it just so happened that it was sort of a time in my life. When I as a young adult. I sort of began my own I guess the wind Journey for myself previous to that growing up in an agricultural. Community I really admired and appreciated the family Wineries and Vineyards that were around it was sort of like there's this I don't say there's a hierarchy but it was kind of like, you know, we have you know, lettuce

2 (44m 3s):
spinach strawberries artichokes and all these

1 (44m 6s):
things and then wind had become the sort of new elevated form of Agriculture an array and the Salinas Valley. So it was kind of like this really, you know, kind of I don't know the bougie sort of thing that had been going on when I was growing up. So it's like I don't always admired that and some of the families that were sort of, you know neighboring where I lived were at the head of that but for myself, I had everyone in wine sort of has their aha moment. It's not it's really corny, but everybody does right and so for me, it was at a friend's house where we were watching TV, and we were having a meal over Italian food and there was a bottle of merlot that we had been drinking and then We drank it all and so my friend brought out another bottle of merlot and you know, just fine.

1 (44m 54s):
It was like we're out of why we need more and so she opened that up. But just in that the difference between the two bottles of wine from the first bottle to the next bottle was the same grape. It was the same vintage. It was the same sort of, you know area of California and yet the styles were so different to me and it was the first time that it really it really stood out to me that there's an art and wine

4 (45m 16s):
making and what are you on? Andrea I mean, I mean clearly both of you were passionate about wine, but you were still in college and also still like really focused on Athletics, right? Yeah. My dream

2 (45m 28s):
was to be an Olympian to be a gold medalist and I had a pretty bad injury and which I came to the realization that like, you know, this was like I wasn't going to get to that dream and it was quite a depressing time, you know, because for I would say since the time I was 14 I mean seriously pursuing, you know, this Olympic dream and then I think in conjunction with that meeting with Robin and in California and really building our bond assisters and those young woman when we would hang out and we would get together.

2 (46m 8s):
Sometimes we would just drive with no like distillation in mind and we were just be talking and we would kind of what we call now just drive and

3 (46m 18s):
dream And we would just talk about like hey, yeah, what would it be? Like if we started our own wine company, you know, you know, what would it

2 (46m 28s):
look like what it would be like and then

3 (46m 31s):
this is these was just kind of like it's like just conversations are friends or sisters or siblings have like hey wouldn't it be great if we start a business together, it was like that. Yeah, it was you know, that's

4 (46m 40s):
so crazy.

2 (46m 42s):
How could we possibly do that? We don't know how to make wine. We have no money. That's crazy. But but how crazy is it though? And then I think in conjunction with with having this

1 (46m 52s):
injury and realizing that you know, I wasn't

2 (46m 54s):
gonna go to the Olympics that I was a junior that pretty soon. I was going to have to get a job in

3 (46m 60s):
the real world

2 (47m 3s):
that for me at least it kind of was like, what do I want served to go through these questions that what do I want to do it in my life. What do I love picking? Me and Robin

1 (47m 13s):
do something together?

3 (47m 15s):
Maybe we could start a winery. Yeah,

1 (47m 17s):
and I feel like you know No, really

3 (47m 19s):
quickly at the

2 (47m 21s):
time. We felt

1 (47m 23s):
like we could do something that

2 (47m 26s):
no other Winery and the world could do and that was that we could authentically make wine and

3 (47m 36s):
two different hemispheres

1 (47m 37s):
and I think the thing for us

3 (47m 40s):
that was very

2 (47m 41s):
clear when we were exploring the wine world

1 (47m 44s):
was that it didn't feel very inclusive,

3 (47m 47s):
but also,

2 (47m 49s):
To from a

1 (47m 50s):
consumer

2 (47m 51s):
perspective. I'm a millennial robbers as genetic sir. We're quite promiscuous and the way that we drink and that like we don't want to drink the same thing every night. So we felt like, you know, we could really offer this like beautiful portfolio of wines that every night of the week. If you wanted to change it up try something different you could do that with us.

4 (48m 17s):
All right, Robin. I just I'm just trying to put myself in your shoes. Right because you like you've been working like you had a job in the corporate world in like some experience there. You are 30 years old. And and one thing I haven't even mentioned is at this point. You were a mom

2 (48m 33s):
right? Laughs. Yeah, like over this whole period you've

4 (48m 36s):
been raising a daughter. So so all this is happening and then like this opportunity presents itself, but the wine industry is super tough like it's super

3 (48m 46s):
intimidating. So The Who The first

4 (48m 47s):
question I would have is that right? Like what's the first step like? Okay. Do you want to start a wine business brand like

2 (48m 54s):
what do we do? And so

4 (48m 56s):
how did you answer that

1 (48m 57s):
question? Well adding even more complexity to the situation. I had just given birth to

3 (49m 2s):
twins. So and that was

1 (49m 5s):
kind of part of the disk the deciding factor or our motivation because of that point. I was like, I have given all I have to give to traditional Corporate America like I have no more to give and I have my daughter who's you know 10 at this point and I have two brand-new baby boys, and there's no way that I'm going to go and you know grind for someone else's company is yeah, that's not going to happen. I don't have all day to toil away for someone else. So and you know timing being what it was at the same time. Andria's like crap. I need to think about my future and what I'm going to do so for us, You know all through our story there's these points where it's just everything lines up and things are laid out in front of us and we just happen to be good at recognizing these opportunities as are set forth, but it's

4 (50m 2s):
scary. I mean you're a I've got a ten-year-old and two new

3 (50m 6s):
twins and

4 (50m 8s):
I mean a lot of people in that situation wouldn't wouldn't be brave enough or courageous enough to start a

1 (50m 14s):
business. Well, I'll tell you one thing that we clearly Syd from dear old dad is that both of us we don't really have much of a Fear Factor in our

3 (50m 25s):
genes. So there's really nothing. That was scary. That's about it. Gary is exciting. Yeah, exactly. And so I

1 (50m 32s):
think we're not really scared about the downside of any situation. We're also realists. So, you know, we realized that we had no experience in the business of wine.

2 (50m 44s):
We also don't have a bunch of money. We didn't have

1 (50m 46s):
Vineyards we didn't have a

3 (50m 47s):
Sorry, we didn't really have anything gradients that it would take six successful business. But what we did

2 (50m 53s):
have was way too much

1 (50m 55s):
confidence. So we felt like it was something it was a challenge that we were up for and now we just need to figure out what was going to be our point of entry into the

2 (51m 4s):
business. And then I think it was just we kept on talking about it and then finally got to the point where we were like

4 (51m 14s):
well what's stopping us?

3 (51m 18s):
And that is where we're going to leave the story for now. I know I know but I promise it will be worth the wait next week. We'll find out how the sisters turn their business into one of the largest black-owned wine companies in the world at that time.

2 (51m 34s):
The wine industry was was a very

3 (51m 36s):
closed off industry

2 (51m 38s):
not a lot of innovation not a lot of disruption. So we looked very foreign and these And I think in their mind they

3 (51m 49s):
think how dare you like the audacity, you know, don't you know how this works and this industry more from the right sisters next week and thanks so much for listening to the show this week. You can subscribe wherever you get your podcast. You can also write to us at each
