    "    You are a transcription assistant. You are given portions of a transcription in order to extract the guests answer.\n",
    "    We are working with transcriptions from the podcast \"How I Built This\" where the host Guy Raz interviews entrepreneurs. \n",
    "    Typically towards the end of the interview he will ask a question regarding to what extent the entrepreneur attributes their success to skill, hard work, and/or intelligence versus luck.\n",
    "    Your task is to extract the answer from the transcriptions. Remember that these are transcriptions so words can be mispelled like \"lock\" instead of \"luck\" or \"intelligents\" instead of \"intelligence\".\n",
    "\n",
    "    The answer is typically a few sentences long and can be found in the same paragraph or in the following paragraphs depending on their thoughts.\n",
    "    If you don't see a relevant question and answer in the transcript, respond with \"Question/Answer not found.\"\n",

    "    Question: When you think about the success of what you created, how much do you think it has to do with, with how hard you worked and your intelligence and how much do you think it had to do with luck?\n",
    "    Answer: It's probably 50 50. Look, I, I actually, so I think every CEO who I've met, they have some minimum level of intelligence, right. But they're oftentimes not the smartest person in the room. And I, I would put myself in that category too. Like, I'm, you know, I met some minimum bar, but I'm not the smartest person. What I am is probably quite determined. There is a part of my personality. This might be a little bit like that being on the spectrum thing or whatever, but it's just like, whether it's like a really good day or a really bad day, I'm sort of even keeled. And I'm often just like, okay, well what's the next step? How do we fix it? And let's keep making progress even over like a decade or more. I can be quite resilient in that regard. But I guess the other thing I would say just about luck, absolutely luck played a big role in Coinbase. I mean, there were certain moments early on in our history where if a coin had flipped the other way we might not be here. I think we got very lucky with sort of the timing of when the company decided to launch and when crypto decided to grow, I think that I kind of just kept trying things until eventually one of them hit. Right. Which is, it's a way of unifying those two ideas. It's, it's definitely a lot of luck when it works. But if you just keep trying, you can kind of make your own luck.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Question: Do you, I mean, obviously worked extremely hard making this happen, but I think you did have some incredibly fortunate breaks that you'd like, you couldn't control like male camp. Do you, are, are you a believer in luck or do you think that what happened really has to do with just how strategic and smart you guys were?\n",
    "    Answer: I totally believe in luck. I mean, but I think it comes from constantly striving and looking for that silver bullet. And when I look back on my 20 years, it felt like I was always looking for the answer, always looking for what is the playbook that I'm missing? You know, it's constantly searching. And then all along the way, stumbling upon something that actually does better than my wildest dreams. I don't know. It, it, I, I, I always had in my mind that I was just a bumbling idiot from of a Georgia who stumbled into business. And somewhere out there, someone knew the right answer of how to run my business. Right. And these days, these days, you know, MailChimp is much bigger. And I get invited to ritzy events with some really great business leaders. And I remember being in one recently where a head of one of Microsoft's cloud units, he was, he was speaking about his, how he hosts executive leadership meetings. And he says, we're still winging it. We have no idea. You know, he didn't say it that way, but he's like, we're still experimenting. You know? And this is Microsoft. And they've been around a very, very long time and they know what they're doing. So, you know, it was that moment. I realized, oh my God, nobody has the answer. We're all just winging it. Every one of us is just winging it. I don't know if that's hopeful or horrifying, but that's what I've learned.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Question ...do you think it has more to do with just your intelligence and your skill or do you think that luck was a bigger factor in everything that's happened to you\n",
    "    Answer: so the thing I always say about lock I think it is it's the lottery and so you get sort of lottery tickets for how you know it's like how good your idea is how good your team is and how hard you work and so you take those like factors and I think how hard you work in your team or probably even bigger factors than the the idea but you still need to have something that actually would work and so you take those three things together and you get for each sort of our of production or work you get a lottery ticket and so just like the lottery if you unless you own every ticket you're not guaranteed to win because I've seen people that have are smarter than me better than me better idea than me fail because of things like luck like things not going their way and I've seen again the opposite of that and so we have been fortunate to have been have lots of Lucky breaks in our Direction but we also continue to work to get more tickets so that we could win the lottery\n",
