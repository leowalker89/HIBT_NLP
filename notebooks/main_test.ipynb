One is one, but one in one is not two. It becomes 11. And the third one becomes 111. And as every family member joined our growth possibilities increased and we were able to do a lot more. Yeah. And I, I think, I think about this question, you know, a couple of different ways, you know, one is perspective for mom. If she hadn't taken the right attitude towards the fire and worked through that fire situation, or, you know, done, done so many things where it was a make or break moment for the company that we wouldn't be here today and that's pure hard work, but for me, it's, it's luck. You know, it's being born into a certain family, having a certain mom that would do those types of things. And so it's not an either or, but a both. So, you know, 17 years coming into the country, we worked certain there and I worked seven days a week, 14 hours a day. The only time we would get together was a Sunday evening when everybody did their farmer's markets or demos and came back, that was the only meal in the evening that we all shared together. It was sheer hard labor that we did. And the children of course put in just as much from day one. So those were the things which really, I think, supplied the fire and the fuel to the company.\n",

When I was in film school, one of our teachers was the now late director of Mueller Foreman and someone said to him one day, how do you make a good movie? And pardon my bad check accent, milish Mueller said, well, making good movies, he's 90% casting. And as the other 10% is also casting. And so that's how I think of business. It's 90% luck and the other 10% is also luck. And then just like Lena said, there's a whole separate a hundred percent where it's 90% working your butt off and the other 10% hopefully being smart enough or finding someone smart enough to know how to put out the fires that started overnight despite the fact that nothing changed since yesterday.

You have to realize that it's a part while at the same time working as if it doesn't matter. I think it helps you not pat yourself on the back too hard when things go right while at the same time not getting too hard on yourself when things don't go right. Some things are just out of your control and luck is definitely one of them. I think the older I get, I'm not sure if I believe in luck as much, but I definitely believe that there's something out of your control, some sort of divine help. All of the important things that have happened in my life, including starting this business with Spencer and meeting my wife and having kids and all of those other important things I don't really consider as luck, but as things that I was blessed with.

And then when I converted to Judaism last February, I became acquainted with this concept of kismet, which is, I don't even pronouncing it right, probably, but it's kind of the intersection of luck and serendipity. And maybe even some measure of destiny. I don't want to go that far because I still don't know why really bad things happen to good people. So I think you've gotta be open in life to the way that the universe is trying to help you. The people who love you, who if you just listened to them and cultivate relationships with people who are direct will tell you what you need to hear. If it's not what you want to hear the same thing at accompany, the people along the way, your board, your investors, your employees, who know as a collective, what to do more so than you, but in combination. And you can unlock that. So I think if you bring self-awareness and you bring empathy and you bring positivity and you bring intellectual honesty and courage, you ultimately try to make good decisions. I think you can influence a lot, but I would attribute this outcome in this company at the end of the day to three things, to the quality of the people around me on all fronts, to the hard work of those people who, who really believed in this and made this happen, the team, and then a healthy, healthy dose of self-awareness in the pursuit of, of kismet. I am. I think that the two things that you're the two really big things that influence your life, the family that you're born into.

And I think those moments that that hit you, that make you, that are just the spark of an idea. I mean those are just lucky moments. The fact that Galen's girls couldn't find the orange jackets, as annoying as that was at the time, was the, the spark, you know, of an idea that I don't know if we would've come to otherwise. And at the same time, I think we would certainly say in e-commerce in particular, if anyone thinks it's glamorous, it just isn't. And to be successful in e-commerce, I mean it is just a lot of grinding it out, a lot of like blocking and tackling how many more cliches can I use? It just, it just is. And so I think that there's no way that an enormous amount of hard work isn't necessary to be successful in this industry. I think we've just learned too how important timing is to whether something can work or not. And so I think probably on balance, I lean a little more luck as the answer. And I think too, so many founders and companies have like worked so hard and had a good idea and been really smart about it, but it just didn't quite work. And so I think, yeah, there's a little bit of like, we've, we've been lucky on the timing and some of the decisions that we happen to get right? 'cause I think the, the difference between like a company that makes it and a company doesn't often comes down to something like really small. So feel very lucky to be where we are.\n",

And we put a lot of time and effort into it and we edited it and we looked at it and we said, I don't like the way it looks like it's okay. No one would really bat an eye at it, but that's not the vision that we had. And we, we went and we redid the whole thing. Right. So that's just so classic dude. Perfect. We have this bar that I think is a lot higher than what most people imagine. It would be at least online. So on the hard work side, I mean, I'm not gonna lie.

He's just a smart guy. Like that's pure luck. Like how did I have that conversation with her? And she pointed me to Roy, if we didn't have Roy Schwartz, Axio wouldn't have existed. Hmm.

One of my parents, good friends, John Whitehead, when I was growing up, he was a businessman and I always saw him as a real mentor. And I used to love spending time with him talking about business and going to some of his businesses and just learning from what he was doing. And he gave me a great bit of advice. Once he said to me, with all these things, he says, get as much information as you can, but then go with your gut instinct because he said to me, he said, you've got a good instinct. He said, go with it. And I've always drawn back on that. And it served me well.\n",

      "Well, you know, somebody told me a long time ago, very wise man told me a long time ago, luck comes to those who work 24 hours a day, seven days a week. So, you know, you're cast a net wide enough, you're bound to catch a little bit of luck. You know, I'm considered one of the, the best chefs in, in the country, yet I know there are, you know, many chefs out there who are better than I am. And why was I chosen? Like why do I live this life? Why do I sit here with you talking about my career and not another chef? Well, some of that has to do with being in the right place at the right time. But there has to be, you know, the desire and the determination and the commitment to actually go out and try to do what we do in order to actually have that opportunity to be lucky.\n",
